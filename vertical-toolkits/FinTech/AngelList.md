# **AngelList: The Platform Powering the Startup Ecosystem**

AngelList is a dynamic online platform that connects startups with angel investors, venture capitalists, job seekers, and other entrepreneurial resources. [^85i3co] [^c8i83r] As a central hub for early-stage companies and backers, it plays a crucial role in accelerating innovation by simplifying the processes of fundraising, hiring, and investment. [^4bi7c2] [^tssxv9] AngelList’s significance stems from its ability to democratize access to capital and talent in the competitive startup landscape, making it a cornerstone of the modern entrepreneurial ecosystem.

Founded in 2010 and headquartered in San Francisco, AngelList began as a matchmaking service between startups and investors but has since blossomed into a comprehensive infrastructure provider for the global startup economy. [^tssxv9] [^k9fchu] The platform’s core functions include fundraising, capital management, job postings, recruiting, and community building. [^4bi7c2] [^tssxv9] For startups, AngelList streamlines the traditionally complex fundraising process; founders can create detailed profiles, pitch to over 100,000 accredited investors, and use tools for managing investor relations. [^4bi7c2] Notable companies such as Stripe, SpaceX, and Epic Games have raised capital through AngelList, underlining its value for high-growth ventures. [^fr7bxs] 

The practical uses of AngelList extend far beyond investment. Startups use the platform to post jobs and tap into a pool of millions of candidates interested in startup roles, while job seekers gain access to thousands of current openings (including remote jobs) in technology, health, finance, and more. [^4bi7c2] [^c8i83r] The transparency of salary data, company information, and role descriptions empowers applicants to make informed decisions, while advanced matching algorithms pair candidates with opportunities aligned to their skillsets and preferences. [^4bi7c2] 

For investors, AngelList is equally transformative. The site facilitates crowdinvesting, where individuals can join syndicates or rolling funds to invest alongside experienced lead investors, sometimes with as little as a few hundred dollars. [^fr7bxs] Fund managers can launch venture funds or single-deal special purpose vehicles, taking advantage of AngelList’s automated fund administration, regulatory compliance, and banking tools. [^fr7bxs] [^tssxv9] This accessibility allows a broader array of participants to join deals previously reserved for institutional investors. [^k9fchu]
