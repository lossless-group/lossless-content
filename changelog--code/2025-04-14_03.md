# Summary
Automated the generation and injection of banner images for all Markdown prompt files in `/content/lost-in-public/prompts/workflow` using a custom Python script and the Recraft API.

## Why Care
This workflow ensures every prompt has a visually relevant, AI-generated banner image, improving the visual quality and consistency of documentation. It also enforces security and maintainability by using environment variables and externalized style configuration.

# Implementation

## Changes Made
- Set up Python virtual environment in the `a-labs` submodule. 
- Created and configured the Recraft API key and other parameters necessary for successful AI image generation.
- Selected five sample images that allowed us to develop our own "style" for the Recraft API.
- Updated and ran `ai-labs/recraft/generate-banner-images-recraft.py` to process all prompts for the prompt library.
- Script loads a custom style from a JSON file and securely loads the Recraft API token from environment variables.
- Robust error handling for missing tokens or invalid styles.

## Technical Details
- The script uses the `image_prompt` field to generate images via the Recraft API and injects the returned URL into the `banner_image` field.
- All API tokens are loaded from environment variables; no sensitive data is hardcoded.
- Custom style configuration is stored in a JSON file for reproducibility.
- Aggressive commenting and DRY principles followed throughout the script.

## Integration Points
- All prompt files in `/content/lost-in-public/prompts/` now include a `banner_image` field.
- No breaking changes to existing metadata or content structure.
- Future prompt/image generation workflows should build on this pattern.

## Documentation
- See `/ai-labs/recraft/generate-banner-images-recraft.py` for script logic and usage.
- used the [[lost-in-public/prompts/workflow/Ask-Generative-AI-model-to-generate-a-Style.md|Ask Generative AI model to generate a Style]] to get GPT 4.1 to generate the image_prompt values. 
- All changes follow the changelog entry guidelines in `/content/lost-in-public/prompts/workflow/Write-a-Code-Changelog-Entry.md`.
- The script workflow is now fully recursive and supports robust error handling for missing tokens or invalid styles.

### Content & Metadata Enhancements
- **YAML Frontmatter Updates:**
  - Added or updated `banner_image` fields in all processed workflow prompt files, ensuring each has a visually relevant, AI-generated image.
  - Maintained strict preservation of all existing metadata and formatting.

### Security & Configuration
- **Environment Variables:**
  - All API tokens are securely loaded from environment variables; no sensitive data is hardcoded.
  - Custom style configuration is externalized to a JSON file for easy updates and reproducibility.

### Code Quality & Documentation
- **Aggressive Commenting and DRY Principles:**
  - Script and workflow changes are thoroughly commented, following the projectâ€™s aggressive documentation standards.
  - Modular, single-source-of-truth approach for style and token management.

### Next Steps
- Review generated banner images for creative quality and relevance.
- Continue to iterate on prompt and image generation workflows as needed.
