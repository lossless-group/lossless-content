# Summary
Restructured the Nix flake configuration into modular components for better maintainability and separation of concerns, with dedicated modules for core development tools, language-specific setups, and editor configurations.

## Why Care
- Assures reproducible builds and that any contributor may choose to use the same development environment
- Streamlines a lot of "setup" choices and tasks. 
- Improved maintainability through modular design
- Better separation of development environment components
- Easier to add or modify specific tooling without affecting other parts

## Technical Details

### Module Structure
1. **Core Development Tools** (`devshell.nix`)
   - Essential CLI tools (git, ripgrep, fd, etc.)
   - Shell and terminal emulator support
   - Core utility replacements (bat, exa, tree)

2. **Language Support**
   - **Rust** (`rust.nix`): Toolchain, cargo extensions, build tools
   - **Node.js** (`nodejs-devshell.nix`): Runtime, pnpm, TypeScript support

3. **Editor Support**
   - **Base Editors** (`editors.nix`): Helix, Neovim, Windsurf
   - **VSCode** (`vscode.nix`): Extensions, language servers, snippets

### Key Features
- Consistent language server protocol (LSP) support across editors
- Integrated formatter and linter configurations
- Shared development tools and utilities
- Environment-specific variables and paths

### Implementation Notes
- Uses flake-parts for modular configuration
- Leverages overlays for Rust and Neovim nightly
- Maintains compatibility with existing .vscode setup
- Supports cross-platform development (Linux and macOS)

## Impact and Usage
- **Developers**: Single command to set up complete development environment
- **Project**: Consistent tooling and formatting across codebase
- **Maintenance**: Easier updates and modifications through modularity

## Future Considerations
- Monitor tool versions and update as needed
- Consider adding more language-specific modules
- Evaluate additional editor integrations
- Keep VSCode snippets and templates in sync with development practices
