# Major Markdown Pipeline Overhaul—Micromark-First, Proprietary Extensions, and Deep Technical Documentation

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Technical Documentation
- **Created:**
  - `How-Micromark-Handles-Markdown-AST.md` — In-depth, step-by-step technical guide to micromark's pipeline, extension points, and tokenization model.
  - `How-Remark-GFM-renders-Tables.md` — Exhaustive breakdown of how remark-gfm leverages micromark and mdast-util-gfm to parse/render tables, with guidance for independent reimplementation.
- **Purpose:**
  - To serve as a single source of truth for future markdown architecture, debugging, and extension development.

### 2. Prompt for Contractors/Developers
- **Created:**
  - `Our-Extended-Markdown-Requirements-as-a-Micromark-Extension.md` — Ultra-explicit, actionable prompt for building our entire extended markdown flavor as a set of micromark extensions, bypassing remark/unified entirely.
- **Purpose:**
  - To enable direct, low-level, maintainable extension development and onboarding for new contributors.

### 3. Pipeline Philosophy and Spec Alignment
- **Aligned:**
  - All new documentation and prompts reference and enforce the requirements in `Maintain-a-Proprietary-Extended-Markdown-Flavor-Rendering-Pipeline.md`.
  - Emphasized strict processing order, modular extension design, aggressive commenting, and error handling.

### 4. Project Rules and Constraints
- **Reinforced:**
  - No new files outside assigned locations or naming conventions.
  - All extension logic must be implemented as micromark constructs.
  - TypeScript is preferred for all extension logic.

## Rationale
- This overhaul is motivated by the need for full control, transparency, and extensibility in our markdown pipeline—removing unified/remark as a bottleneck and source of complexity.
- The new documentation and prompts will drastically accelerate onboarding, debugging, and future feature development.

## Next Steps
- Begin implementation of proprietary micromark extensions per the new prompt and documentation.
- Use the technical guides as the foundation for all future markdown-related work.
