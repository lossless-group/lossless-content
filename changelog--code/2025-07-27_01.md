# Summary
Isolated LM Studio related functionality and UI from Perplexed in keeping with the Content Farm family of plugins.  Implemented it as a "plugin-module" from within Content Farm.  It can be used in isolation as well. 

## Why Care? 
LM Studio is a developer friendly AI Model Workspace.  It is a great way to generate content using locally stored models with the LLM Studio API.  It can also be used to augment, edit, or reformat content using Model Context Protocol
