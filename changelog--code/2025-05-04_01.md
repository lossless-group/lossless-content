# Summary
Implemented tag-based filtering for essays, fixed Astro frontmatter syntax, and ensured DRY, maintainable code across tag and index pages.

***

## Why Care
This update enables users to view the "Essays" collection, founded in the content repository(`content/essays`), and filter essays by tag, improving SEO, navigation, and discoverability. 

***

# Implementation

## Changes Made
- **Created pages for Essays collection**, including `/site/src/pages/read/index.astro` and `/site/src/pages/read/more-on/[tag].astro`.
- **Added tag-based filtering logic** to `/site/src/pages/read/more-on/[tag].astro` replicating the robust filtering, sorting, and mapping from the main index page.

- **Ensured consistent data structure** for essay items and DRY code between index and tag-filtered pages.
- **Created and updated**:
    - `/site/src/pages/read/index.astro`
    - `/site/src/pages/read/more-on/[tag].astro`
    - `/site/components/articles/ArticleListColumn.astro`
    - `src/pages/read/essays/[...slug].astro`
    - `/site/astro.config.mjs`
- **Staged and committed** all code changes, and pushed to the remote repository.

***

## Technical Details
- All filtering, mapping, and sorting logic is now inside the Astro frontmatter for compliance and maintainability.
- Tag filtering is case-insensitive and only published essays are included.
- Debug output (`console.log(essayItems)`) is available for inspection in the browser console.
- No new dependencies were added; all changes are within the existing Astro/TypeScript stack.

***

## Integration Points
- TagChip and ArticleListColumn components are reused for DRY rendering.
- The new tag-filtered page integrates seamlessly with the unified routing and essay data structure.
- No migration steps required; no breaking changes introduced.
