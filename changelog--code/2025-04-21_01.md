# Summary

Comprehensive refactor and enhancement of the Changelog UI, including major improvements to the `ChangelogEntry` component and `ChangelogLayout`, with integration into site-wide layouts and navigation.


## Why Care

A robust, readable, and extensible changelog system is essential for tracking project history, surfacing technical decisions, and communicating changes to all stakeholders. This update makes changelogs more accessible, visually clear, and easier to maintain, supporting both developers and documentation consumers.

***

# Implementation

## Changes Made

- **Refactored** `src/components/changelog/ChangelogEntry.astro` for improved modularity, maintainability, and visual clarity.
- **Overhauled** `src/layouts/ChangelogLayout.astro` to support new UI structure and enhanced navigation.
- **Updated** `src/components/basics/Header.astro` and `src/layouts/Layout.astro` for integration with the new changelog system.
- **Minor update** to `package.json` for dependency alignment.
- **Total impact:** 225 insertions, 103 deletions.
- **No new runtime dependencies** added; only internal code and layout changes.

***

## Technical Details

- The `ChangelogEntry.astro` component now features improved sectioning, better metadata rendering, and clearer separation of content areas.
- `ChangelogLayout.astro` was restructured for easier navigation between changelog entries and improved responsiveness.
- Header and main site layout were updated to surface changelog navigation and ensure seamless integration.
- Code style and documentation were improved throughout for maintainability.
- Example usage:
  ```astro
  ---
  import ChangelogEntry from '../components/changelog/ChangelogEntry.astro';
  ---
  <ChangelogEntry entry={entry} />
  ```

***

## Integration Points

- The new changelog components are now integrated into the main site layout and header.
- All changelog pages use the new layout and component structure.
- No migration steps required for existing entries, but future entries will benefit from improved rendering.

***

## Documentation

- Inline documentation has been updated in all affected files.
- Refer to `content/lost-in-public/prompts/workflow/Write-a-Code-Changelog-Entry.md` for changelog entry standards.
- See updated `src/components/changelog/ChangelogEntry.astro` and `src/layouts/ChangelogLayout.astro` for implementation details.
