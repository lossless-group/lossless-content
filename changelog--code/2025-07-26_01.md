# Summary
Implemented a unified search functionality across reference pages, providing consistent behavior and styling for improved content discoverability.

## Why Care
This enhancement improves content discoverability across the reference section by providing users with a consistent and intuitive search experience. The implementation ensures that users can quickly find relevant vocabulary terms and concepts across all reference pages.

# Implementation

## Changes Made
- Enhanced SearchInput component with improved selector logic
  - File: `src/components/reference/SearchInput.astro`
  - Updated search selector to handle both attribute-only and value-based data-searchable elements
  - Added support for title and description-specific element searching

- Modified reference pages for consistency
  - Files:
    ```
    src/pages/more-about/
    ├── vocabulary.astro
    ├── concepts.astro
    └── index.astro
    ```
  - Updated data-searchable attributes to use explicit "true" value
  - Maintained consistent search behavior across all reference pages

## Technical Details
- Search Implementation:
  ```typescript
  // SearchInput.astro
  const items = document.querySelectorAll('[data-searchable]:not([data-searchable="false"])');
  ```
  This selector matches both presence-only and value-based data-searchable attributes while explicitly excluding false values.

## Integration Points
- SearchInput component is now used in:
  - Reference pages (vocabulary, concepts, index)
- Component styling matches the site's dark theme
- Search behavior is consistent across all implementations

## Documentation
- SearchInput Integration:
  - Use `data-searchable="true"` on elements that should be searchable
  - Search looks for content in elements with `data-title` and `data-description` attributes
  - Falls back to full text content if specific elements aren't found
