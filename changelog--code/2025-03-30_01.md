## Changes Implemented

1. **Removed Legacy Configuration**
   - Deleted: `src/utils/markdown/marked-config.ts`
   - Reason: Transitioning from Marked to Remark for enhanced markdown processing

2. **Added Remark Backlinks Support**
   Successfully implemented backlink processing for the following formats:
   - Basic wiki-style: `[[content/tooling/filename]]`
   - Custom display text: `[[path/to/file|Display Text]]`
   - Nested paths: `[[content/lost-in-public/prompts/file]]`
   - Case-insensitive matching: `[[Content/Specs/file]]`

## Testing Results

Verified successful transformation of various link formats:

```markdown
[[content/tooling/Some File Name]] -> Correct path resolution
[[content/tooling/Some Other File|Custom Display Text]] -> Display text preserved
[[content/lost-in-public/prompts/user-interface/Some Deep File]] -> Nested paths working
[[content/Specs/API Documentation/Auth Flow]] -> Case handling verified
```

- [[Tooling/AI-Toolkit/AI Infrastructure/Axolotl AI]] (Fixed closing delimiter placement)
- [[Tooling/AI-Toolkit/AI Infrastructure/Carbon]] (Fixed closing delimiter placement)
- [[Tooling/AI-Toolkit/AI Interfaces/Midori AI]] (Fixed closing delimiter placement)
- [[Noan]] (Fixed closing delimiter placement)
- [[Tooling/AI-Toolkit/AI Interfaces/Uberduck]] (Fixed closing delimiter placement)
- [[Tooling/AI-Toolkit/AI Programming Frameworks/Gradio]] (Fixed closing delimiter placement)

## Technical Details

- **Plugin**: Remark Backlinks Plugin
- **Integration**: Astro markdown configuration
- **Scope**: All internal markdown content

## Validation

Tested with various link formats including:
- Standard wiki-style links
- Links with custom display text
- Deeply nested path references
- Mixed case and space-containing paths

All link formats now render correctly in the Astro build.

Testing various link formats:

1. Simple backlink: [[content/tooling/Some File Name]]
2. Backlink with display text: [[content/tooling/Some Other File|Custom Display Text]]
3. Nested path: [[content/lost-in-public/prompts/user-interface/Some Deep File]]
4. Mixed case with spaces: [[content/Specs/API Documentation/Auth Flow]]
5. Regular markdown link: [External Link](https://example.com)

Let's see how these are processed by our marked configuration!

- [[Tooling/Software Development/Programming Languages/Libraries/Pagefind]] (Fixed closing delimiter placement)
- [[Tooling/Software Development/Programming Languages/Libraries/PrismJS]] (Fixed closing delimiter placement)
- [[Tooling/Software Development/Programming Languages/Libraries/Stow]] (Fixed closing delimiter placement)
- [[Tooling/Software Development/Programming Languages/Libraries/Zustand]] (Fixed closing delimiter placement)
- [[Tooling/Web Browsers/Floorp]] (Fixed closing delimiter placement)
- [[Tooling/Web Browsers/Glarity]] (Fixed closing delimiter placement)
