# Summary

Re-architected the Client Portal to be fully markdown-driven via MOC (Map of Contents) directives. The portal now reads per-client feature toggles, featured portfolio items, and reference terms (vocabulary and concepts) directly from `content/moc/<Client>.md`. Removed legacy JSON fallback for reference terms and preserved original capitalization throughout the reference pipeline. Also added a featured portfolio grid to the client landing page.

***

## Why Care

- Single source of truth in markdown: editors can author all client-facing selections in one place.
- Eliminates brittle JSON duplication and reduces drift between data sources.
- Preserves capitalization (e.g., "AI Models", "AI Avatars") for higher fidelity presentation.
- Enables fast per-client customization (cards, portfolios, terms) without code changes.

# Implementation

## Changes Made

- Client landing layout
  - Edited: `site/src/layouts/ClientPortalLayout.astro`
    - Parse `:::features` to filter `clientPortalCards.json` per client.
    - Parse `:::portfolio` and render `PortfolioCard` items directly on the landing page.
    - Parse `:::vocabulary` and `:::concepts` and pass them as props to the reference section.
    - Added responsive grid styling for the featured portfolio section.

- Reference section
  - Edited: `site/src/components/client-portals/ClientReferenceSection.astro`
    - Switched to markdown-driven props (`selectedVocabulary`, `selectedConcepts`) only.
    - Removed JSON filesystem fallback and all fs/path imports.
    - Preserved original casing; removed `toProperCase` in fallback title logic.
    - Refactored to use `processEntries` from `site/src/utils/slugify.ts` to normalize entries similarly to the reference index page.
    - Converted processed entries into `ReferenceItem` shape expected by `ReferenceGrid`.

- MOC files
  - Added/updated per-client files with directive blocks:
    - `content/moc/Laerdal.md`
    - `content/moc/Tonguc.md`
    - `content/moc/Param.md`
    - `content/moc/Hypernova.md`
    - `content/moc/Avalanche.md`
    - `content/moc/Flourish.md`
    - `content/moc/Colearn.md`
    - `content/moc/Obsidian Plugin Community.md`
  - Each may include:
    ```md
    :::features
    - Reader
    - Projects
    - Portfolio
    - Recommendations
    :::

    :::portfolio
    - [[Aalo Atomics]]
    - [[Pencil Spaces]]
    :::

    :::vocabulary
    - [[Agile]]
    - [[AI Models]]
    :::

    :::concepts
    - [[Coherence]]
    - [[AI Avatars]]
    :::
    ```

- Removed files (JSON fallback for reference terms)
  - Deleted: `content/client-content/Laerdal/reference-terms.json`
  - Deleted: `content/client-content/Param/reference-terms.json`
  - Deleted: `content/client-content/Tonguc/reference-terms.json`

## Technical Details

- Features filtering
  - The layout loads `src/content/messages/clientPortalCards.json` (unchanged structure) and filters by normalized names from `:::features`.
  - Includes alias handling (e.g., common misspelling "Reccomendations" → "Recommendations").

- Featured portfolio
  - `:::portfolio` list parsed from `content/moc/<Client>.md`.
  - Resolution uses existing `resolvePortfolioId` in `site/src/utils/toolUtils.ts` and the `client-portfolios` collection; no new path logic.
  - Each resolved entry is rendered with `PortfolioCard` in a responsive grid at the top of the landing page.

- Reference terms (vocabulary, concepts)
  - The layout parses `:::vocabulary` and `:::concepts` and passes arrays to `ClientReferenceSection`.
  - The section uses `processEntries` to normalize collection entries and then maps the passed titles to `ReferenceItem`s for `ReferenceGrid`.
  - Casing is preserved by avoiding automatic title-casing transforms.

- Environment-aware content path
  - All filesystem reads for client content and MOC use `contentBasePath`/`resolvedContentPath` from `envUtils`, preserving deploy-specific roots.

***

## Integration Points

- `PortfolioCard` remains the canonical UI for portfolio entries; now also used on the client landing page.
- `ReferenceGrid` continues to render list items, now driven by processed entries to unify behavior with the reference index page.
- No changes required to `content.config.ts`; existing collections are reused.

***

## Migration Steps

1. For each client, ensure a `content/moc/<Client>.md` exists (Proper Case, spaces allowed).
2. Move any reference terms from deleted `reference-terms.json` into the appropriate MOC blocks:
   - `:::vocabulary` for vocabulary entries
   - `:::concepts` for concept entries
3. If using featured portfolio, add a `:::portfolio` block with a bullet list of references (backlink syntax preferred: `[[Name]]`).
4. Optionally add a `:::features` block to control which portal cards display.

***

## Breaking Changes

- JSON fallback for reference terms has been removed. If `:::vocabulary`/`:::concepts` are not defined for a client, their reference section will be empty.

***

## Documentation

- Authoring MOC blocks occurs in `content/moc/<Client>.md`.
- Reference: `site/src/pages/more-about/index.astro` demonstrates `processEntries` normalization now mirrored in `ClientReferenceSection`.

***

## Follow-ups

- Add validation or build-time warnings when MOC references cannot be resolved (e.g., portfolio names that don’t match entries).
- Consider surfacing counts/logs on the client page to aid troubleshooting (hidden dev mode).
