Integrated Tailwind CSS into our Astro project to provide utility-first CSS capabilities. Tailwind CSS allows for rapid UI development by providing a comprehensive set of utility classes that can be composed directly in HTML/JSX markup.

## Changes Made

1. Added Tailwind CSS Vite plugin to `astro.config.mjs`
2. Created new stylesheet `starwind.css` for Tailwind imports
3. Updated `Layout.astro` to include Tailwind styles

## Technical Details

- **Configuration**: Tailwind is integrated through Vite's plugin system, allowing seamless compilation of utility classes
- **Implementation**: Utility classes can now be used directly in `.astro` components for styling
- **Performance**: Tailwind's JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler ensures only used utilities are included in the final bundle

## Usage Example

```astro
<div class="flex items-center justify-between p-4 bg-gray-100">
  <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Example Component</h1>
  <button class="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded hover:bg-blue-600">
    Action
  </button>
</div>
```

This change provides a modern, maintainable approach to styling our components while ensuring optimal performance through Tailwind's build-time optimizations.
