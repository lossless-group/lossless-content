# Summary
Updated `PostCard` layout and `magazine-grid` styles to ensure a clean, centered 3-column layout on larger screens, with proper responsiveness on tablets and mobile devices.

## Why Care
Previous grid behavior was inconsistent across screen sizes. Cards overlapped or spilled due to width constraints and max-width issues, particularly on large screens. This refactor makes the layout clean, consistent, and predictable.

# Implementation

## Changes Made
- Updated grid behavior in `PostCardContentLayout.astro`
- Refined `magazine-grid` styles to use `repeat(3, 1fr)` for large screens
- Adjusted `max-width` and `padding` for proper centering and spacing
- Removed legacy overlapping styles
- Ensured graceful fallback to 2-column and 1-column layouts for medium and small screens

### Files Modified
```
content/components/articles/PostCardContentLayout.astro
content/components/articles/PostCard.astro
content/styles/cards.css
```

## Technical Details
- Used `max-width: 72rem` on `.magazine-grid` for a 3-column cap
- Used `grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr)` and responsive media queries
- `PostCard` image container uses `clamp(14rem, 22vw, 20rem)` for flexible but bounded width

```css
.magazine-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 2rem;
  max-width: 72rem;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 1rem;
}

@media (max-width: 1024px) {
  .magazine-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
    max-width: 48rem;
  }
}

@media (max-width: 640px) {
  .magazine-grid {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    max-width: 100%;
  }
}
```

## Integration Points
- Any pages using `<PostCardContentLayout />` will now have predictable, fluid grids
- No migrations required unless overlapping styles were manually added elsewhere

## Documentation
- No external documentation changes needed; usage pattern remains the same
