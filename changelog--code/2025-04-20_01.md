# Summary
Major update to the OpenGraph metadata processing and filesystem observer logic in the `tidyverse` submodule, including in-memory session-based file tracking, improved error handling, and aggressive, DRY code commenting.

***

## Why Care
These changes eliminate redundant OpenGraph API calls, prevent infinite file processing loops, improve debugging and data traceability, and bring documentation and code samples into alignment with actual implementation. This ensures data integrity, system stability, and maintainability.

***

# Implementation

## Changes Made
- **Modified:** `tidyverse/observers/fileSystemObserver.ts`
  - Added a static in-memory `Set` to track processed files in the current session.
  - Updated `onChange` method to skip files already processed in the session.
  - Aggressive logging for file events and skip logic.
- **Modified:** `tidyverse/observers/services/openGraphService.ts`
  - Updated `needsOpenGraph` function to only trigger fetches for missing or out-of-date OpenGraph fields.
  - Improved error handling: logs and records errors in frontmatter, updates `og_last_fetch` on error.
  - DRY, aggressive commenting throughout OpenGraph-related logic.
- **Documentation:** `content/lost-in-public/prompts/data-integrity/Enhanced-Filesystem-Observer-with-Prompts-Support.md`
  - Added/updated sections and code samples to reflect new logic, rationale, and best practices.

***

## Technical Details
- **Session-Based File Tracking:**
  - `FileSystemObserver` now uses a static `Set` (`processedFiles`) to prevent repeated processing of the same file within a single Node.js process.
  - Ensures each file is only processed once per session.
- **OpenGraph Processing:**
  - `needsOpenGraph` checks for both presence and correctness of all required OG fields before triggering fetch.
  - Skips unnecessary API calls and file writes.
- **Error Handling:**
  - All OpenGraph fetch errors are logged and recorded in frontmatter (`og_error`).
  - `og_last_fetch` is updated on error for traceability.
- **Documentation:**
  - Aggressive, DRY code samples and rationale blocks added to project documentation for maintainability.

***

## Integration Points
- No breaking changes to external APIs or interfaces.
- All changes are internal to the observer and OpenGraph service logic.
- Documentation now matches implementation, supporting onboarding and future development.
