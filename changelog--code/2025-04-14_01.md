# Summary
Integrated citation processing directly into the main `FileSystemObserver` within the `tidyverse/observers` submodule. This removes the need for separate citation processing scripts and unifies file handling logic.

## Why Care
This refactoring simplifies the content processing workflow by handling both frontmatter validation/updates and citation processing within a single, coordinated system. It improves consistency, reduces potential conflicts between operations, and makes the observer system more robust and maintainable. It also centralizes citation logic using a `CitationService` and ensures interaction with the `citation-registry.json`.

# Implementation
The core changes involved modifying the `FileSystemObserver` to incorporate citation handling logic previously specified in `content/lost-in-public/prompts/data-integrity/Refactored-Citations-Observer.md`.

Key implementation steps included:

1.  **Unified Processing:** Integrated citation detection (numeric/hex), conversion (numeric to hex), and registry updates directly into the observer's file processing sequence (`add`/`change` events).
2.  **Centralized Logic:** Introduced a `CitationService` singleton to manage the citation registry (`site/src/content/citations/citation-registry.json`), ensuring consistent loading, checking, updating, and persistence.
3.  **Hex ID Consistency:** Implemented logic to maintain a consistent mapping between numeric citation IDs (e.g., `[123]`) and their generated hex IDs (e.g., `[^abcdef]`) during processing.
4.  **Footnote Handling:** Ensured footnote definitions (`[^abcdef]: Footnote text`) are correctly added or updated in the processed markdown files.
5.  **Conflict Resolution:** Addressed potential race conditions or conflicts between frontmatter updates and citation processing to prevent file corruption or duplicate frontmatter sections.
6.  **Dependency Refinement:** Continued refactoring efforts to minimize reliance on external YAML parsing libraries where possible, using manual construction for better control over output formatting (related to commit `c503704`).

## Files Modified (Likely Candidates)
- `tidyverse/observers/src/FileSystemObserver.ts`
- `tidyverse/observers/src/services/CitationService.ts` (Created/Modified)
- `tidyverse/observers/src/types/` (Updated interfaces/types)
- `tidyverse/observers/src/utils/` (Potentially added citation-specific utilities)
- `tidyverse/observers/index.ts`
- `tidyverse/observers/package.json` (If dependencies changed)

## Future Work
- Further optimize citation processing performance for large numbers of files.
- Enhance reporting to include detailed citation processing statistics.
