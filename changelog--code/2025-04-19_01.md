## Major Features & Improvements

- **Unified Tag Filtering Across Collections**
  - Introduced a new tag filtering system that aggregates and displays items from both the "prompts" and "specs" content collections.
  - Implemented new dynamic routes: `/vibe-with/[tag].astro`, `/vibe-with/[collection]/[...slug].astro`, and `/vibe-with/[collection]/[tag].astro` for seamless cross-collection navigation and filtering.
  - Added a robust utility for slug generation (`src/utils/slugify.ts`) to ensure consistent URL handling across the site.

- **Robust, DRY Article Preview Components**
  - Created `ArticleListNewsPreview.astro` as a new, canonical component for rendering news-style article previews.
  - Refactored `ArticleListColumn.astro` to support modular, columnar rendering of arbitrary entry types, enabling flexible content layouts.
  - Ensured all preview components now receive and correctly handle essential props (`title`, `lede`, `banner_image`, etc.), eliminating missing data and rendering bugs.
  - Updated prop typing and mapping throughout the pipeline for strict type safety and single-source-of-truth data flow.

- **UI/UX Enhancements**
  - Improved visual consistency and accessibility in `CollectionEntryRow.astro` and all tag-related components.
  - Refined color, font-weight, and spacing in article previews for a more professional and legible presentation.
  - Enhanced the tag chip, tag cloud, and related components for better discoverability and filtering experience.

## Technical Debt Addressed

- Removed all hallucinated or unused fields (e.g., `summary`) from type definitions and data pipelines.
- Centralized all mapping and conditional logic in the Astro script blocks, in accordance with project commenting and DRY rules.
- Added or updated comprehensive comment blocks and inline documentation for all affected files and functions.
