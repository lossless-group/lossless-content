# Summary

Implemented a robust environment-based build system to handle different deployment scenarios (LocalSiteOnly, LocalMonorepo, Vercel, Railway) with proper content path resolution and environment variable management.

## Why Care

A reliable build system that works consistently across different environments is crucial for:
- Developer experience
- Deployment reliability
- Content management
- Team collaboration

## Changes

### Added
- New `envUtils.js` module for centralized environment variable management
- Content path resolution based on `DEPLOY_ENV` environment variable
- Comprehensive environment configuration with proper fallbacks
- Logging for environment configuration and content path resolution

### Modified
- Updated build script in `package.json` to properly load environment variables
- Enhanced `content.config.ts` to use the new environment utilities
- Added environment variable type definitions in `env.d.ts`
- Created/updated `.env` and `.env.example` files with documentation

### Fixed
- Resolved content path resolution issues across different environments
- Fixed environment variable loading order and precedence
- Addressed potential race conditions in environment setup

## Technical Details

### Environment Variables
- `NODE_ENV`: Node.js environment (development/production)
- `APP_ENV`: Application environment (matches NODE_ENV if not set)
- `DEPLOY_ENV`: Deployment environment (LocalSiteOnly, LocalMonorepo, Vercel, Railway)

### Supported Deployment Environments
1. **LocalSiteOnly**: Development with content in `src/generated-content`
2. **LocalMonorepo**: Development within the monorepo structure
3. **Vercel**: Production deployment on Vercel
4. **Railway**: Production deployment on Railway

## Testing

To verify the setup:

```bash
# Test LocalSiteOnly
DEPLOY_ENV=LocalSiteOnly pnpm build

# Test LocalMonorepo
DEPLOY_ENV=LocalMonorepo pnpm build
```
