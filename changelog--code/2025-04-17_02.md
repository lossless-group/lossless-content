# Summary
Major architectural advances in the Filesystem Observer and supporting codebase: established atomic, idempotent metadata updates, config-driven logging, and robust error handling to ensure content integrity and maintainability.

## Changes Made

- **Filesystem Observer Spec**
  - Defined and documented the Property Collector Pattern for atomic, non-destructive frontmatter updates.
  - Modularized observer services and templates for extensibility.
  - Required aggressive commenting and audit trails for every mutation.
  - Mandated idempotency: observer can process files repeatedly without redundant writes or infinite loops.

- **Conditional Console Logging**
  - Codified a config-driven pattern for all log statements.
  - All logs remain in code, toggled by user options.
  - Added optional helper for DRYness.
  - Standardized across all observer and pipeline code.

- **Infinite Loop Prevention**
  - Detected and repaired a feedback loop caused by malformed frontmatter.
  - Implemented logic to extract and repair only the first valid YAML block.
  - Adopted atomic property collector orchestration for all observer operations.
  - Ensured only changed key-value pairs are written, and only once per operation.

## Impact

- Guarantees metadata consistency and auditability across all markdown content.
- Eliminates destructive or redundant file operations.
- Enables rapid debugging and safe extensibility for future features.
- Serves as a canonical reference for observer and pipeline architecture.
