# Summary
Refactored the `/client/[client]` and `/client/[client]/essays/[...slug]` routes to use a shared layout with collapsible readers and YAML-driven ToolingGallery integration.

## Why Care
This update unifies the client-specific portal experience across both entry and deep-linked essay routes. It also adds dynamic gallery rendering from YAML configs, improving scalability and editing UX for client pages.

***

# Implementation

## Changes Made
- Unified `pages/client/[client].astro` and `pages/client/[client]/essays/[...slug].astro` under a new `ClientPortalLayout.astro` component
- Moved logic for loading essays, vocab/concepts, and current slug detection into shared layout
- Introduced `content/client/[client]/reference-terms.json` to drive dynamic reference term loading
- Introduced `content/client/[client]/tooling-gallery.yaml` for YAML-configured ToolCard galleries
- Updated `ToolingGallery.astro` component for collapsibility and tag/ID resolution
- Fixed slug casing mismatches (Laerdal vs laerdal) with `.toLowerCase()` normalization
- Added utility `capitalize()` function for display formatting

### File Changes
```
content/client/laerdal/reference-terms.json
content/client/laerdal/tooling-gallery.yaml
src/components/client/ClientPortalLayout.astro
src/components/tool-components/ToolingGallery.astro
pages/client/[client].astro
pages/client/[client]/essays/[...slug].astro
```

## Technical Details

### YAML Parsing:
YAML file syntax such as:
```yaml
- tag: [[Check It Out]]
- langchain-agent-toolkit
```
is parsed using regex to extract and normalize backlink-style tags and IDs.

### Tool Resolution Logic:
Each tool ID or tag is resolved against `getCollection('tooling')` and deduplicated before rendering.

### Slug Matching:
Ensured `slug` matching accounts for trailing path segments:
```ts
const lastSlugSegment = Array.isArray(slug) ? slug.at(-1) : slug;
```

***

## Integration Points
- Relies on `getReferenceSlug()` from `@utils/slugify.ts`
- Supports markdown `toolingGallery` code blocks parsed via custom `rehype` transformer
- Compatible with client JSON + YAML configs

***

## Documentation
- `components/tool-components/ToolingGallery.astro` now supports tag-based filtering via YAML
- Client layouts use `ClientPortalLayout.astro` for SSR-compatible reference rendering
- See `content/client/laerdal/tooling-gallery.yaml` for config examples
