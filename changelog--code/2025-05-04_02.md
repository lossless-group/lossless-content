# Summary
Refined the ImageKit upload script to process only Recraft URLs, migrated essay image frontmatter fields to ImageKit URLs, and added required dependencies to both Python and Node environments.

***

## Why Care
This change ensures only Recraft-generated images are uploaded to ImageKit, prevents redundant or accidental uploads, and standardizes asset hosting. Explicitly documenting new dependencies ensures reproducibility and clarity for future contributors.

***

# Implementation

## Changes Made
- **ai-labs/apis/imagekit/convertImageToImagkitUrl.cjs**
  - Now processes only image URLs starting with `https://img.recraft.ai/`.
  - Added/updated logic, comments, and debug logging for clarity and traceability.
- **content/essays/** (multiple files)
  - Updated `portrait_image` fields from Recraft URLs to new ImageKit URLs.
- **visuals/For/Recraft-Generated/Essays/**
  - Downloaded and backed up all processed images locally.
- **ai-labs/package.json**
  - Added `node-fetch` as a dependency for image downloading.
- **ai-labs/python-requirements.txt**
  - Added `aiohttp` for async HTTP requests in Python scripts.

## Technical Details
- Strict URL match (`imgUrl.startsWith('https://img.recraft.ai/')`) now gates image processing in the Node script.
- Skips all non-Recraft and already-ImageKit URLs.
- `OVERWRITE_IMAGEKIT_URL = false` remains to prevent redundant uploads.
- Markdown frontmatter is updated in-place after successful upload.
- `node-fetch` is used for HTTP requests in JS, and `aiohttp` for async operations in Python.

## Integration Points
- Markdown essays now reference ImageKit URLs, compatible with Astro content collections and CDN delivery.
- No migration steps required for downstream consumers, as URLs are backward compatible.
- No breaking changes; all additions are backward compatible.

## Documentation
- See: [content/lost-in-public/prompts/workflow/Write-a-Code-Changelog-Entry.md](../lost-in-public/prompts/workflow/Write-a-Code-Changelog-Entry.md) for changelog standards.
- Usage examples for scripts are in their respective headers.
- For image pipeline and CDN integration, see project documentation on content collections and image utilities.
