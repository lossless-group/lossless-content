Integrated Starwind UI, a modern component library specifically designed for Astro and styled with Tailwind CSS v4. Unlike traditional component libraries, Starwind UI provides direct access to component source code, allowing for complete customization and control.

## Key Features

1. **Native Astro Integration**
   - Components are written as `.astro` files
   - Takes full advantage of Astro's component architecture
   - Seamless integration with our existing Astro project

2. **Developer Experience**
   - Full TypeScript support with complete type definitions
   - CLI tool for easy component addition
   - Dark mode support out of the box
   - Accessible components with keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Implementation Benefits

- **Source Code Access**: Components can be added directly to our project via CLI, allowing us to:
  - Modify implementation details to match our specific needs
  - Maintain full control over component behavior
  - Customize styling without fighting against preset constraints

- **Modern Stack Alignment**: Built on the same technologies we use:
  - Astro components
  - Tailwind CSS v4
  - TypeScript
  
## Usage Example

```astro
---
import { Button } from '@components/starwind/Button.astro';
import { Card } from '@components/starwind/Card.astro';
---

<Card>
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Example Component</h2>
  <p class="mt-2">Content goes here</p>
  <Button variant="primary" class="mt-4">
    Take Action
  </Button>
</Card>
```

This addition provides us with a robust set of UI components that maintain consistency while allowing for the flexibility needed in our project's design system.
