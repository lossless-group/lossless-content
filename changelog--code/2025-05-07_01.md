# Summary
Refactored the `OneArticleOnPage.astro` layout to properly handle table of contents, mermaid charts, and a new document info sidebar.

## Why Care
These improvements significantly enhance usability and structure of long markdown documents, providing more navigability (TOC), visual clarity (chart expansion), and metadata context (info sidebar).

# Implementation

## Changes Made
- Added a sticky `info-sidebar` on the left for showing document metadata (`path`, `id`, `author`, etc.)
- Refactored `TableOfContents.astro` to apply styles correctly when called from `AstroMarkdown`
- Resolved issues where `.toc-sidebar` styles were not being applied when injected dynamically
- Prevented chart overflow from breaking layout by constraining `.mermaid-breakout` width to container
- Completely rewrote fullscreen logic for Mermaid charts using `toggleMermaidExpand()` with lightbox behavior
- Ensured responsive resizing and modal structure for fullscreen Mermaid rendering
- Added global styles for `mermaid-fullscreen-modal`
- Preserved all sidebar widths across breakpoints
- Ensured fallback TOC title rendering inherits proper styles

## Technical Details
- `OneArticleOnPage.astro`:
  - Introduced `.info-sidebar` and styled it consistently with `.toc-sidebar`
  - Removed duplicate `.toc-sidebar` markup; rendering now fully handled via `AstroMarkdown` and `TableOfContents.astro`
  - Ensured `.content-wrapper` uses flexbox and `align-items: flex-start` to keep sidebar positioning stable
- `TableOfContents.astro`:
  - Renders nested ToC nodes recursively with unified styles
  - Removed redundant hover and text color rules
  - Applied `.toc-scroll-area` wrapper only when content exists, with scroll disabled
- Mermaid chart styling:
  - `.mermaid-chart-shell` now respects container width and avoids overflow
  - `.mermaid-fullscreen-modal` gives fullscreen chart display with high z-index and escape key support
  - Added expand/collapse toggle using inline SVG

## Integration Points
- AstroMarkdown.astro: calls `<TableOfContents />` based on `node.type === "tableOfContents"`
- Relies on `remark-toc` injecting a valid `tableOfContents` node with `data.map` as list

## Documentation
- No external docs modified yet, but README could benefit from a "Markdown Layout Structure" section
- All changes tested in `/pages/vocabulary/[slug].astro` via live Markdown rendering
- Will need follow-up to generalize info-sidebar metadata fields from frontmatter
