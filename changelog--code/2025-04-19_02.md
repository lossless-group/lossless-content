# Summary

Introduced a dynamic, data-driven Footer component for the site, enabling flexible updates via JSON content files and improving maintainability, consistency, and scalability of the site's global layout.

***

## Why Care

This upgrade transforms the footer from a static, hardcoded element into a modular, maintainable, and easily extensible component. Content teams and developers can now update footer links, social icons, and organization locations by editing simple JSON filesâ€”no code changes required. This reduces deployment friction, enables rapid iteration, and ensures consistency across the site.

# Implementation

## Changes Made

- **Component Refactor:**  
  - Replaced the static footer with a new, dynamic implementation in `src/components/basics/Footer.astro`.
  - Footer now loads all content (links, social icons, org locations) from JSON files.
- **Content Data:**  
  - Added `src/content/basics/footerLinks.json` for link columns.
  - Added `src/content/basics/orgLocations.json` for organization names and locations.
  - Added `src/content/basics/socialIcons.json` and `src/content/footer/socialIcons.json` for social media icons.
- **Layout Integration:**  
  - Updated `src/layouts/Layout.astro` to use the new Footer component.
- **File Additions:**  
  - `src/content/basics/footer/columns-links.json` (placeholder for future expansion)
  - All new JSON files are structured for easy editing by non-engineers.
