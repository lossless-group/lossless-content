# Summary
Resolved production 500 errors on Vercel by fixing undated/nonexistent icons in the @tabler library as well as conflicting folders assets/Icons and assets/icons. Also removed legacy callouts code that is no longer in use.

***

## Why Care
Without fixing the asset management system, Astro builds worked locally but crashed with Internal Server Errors on Vercel. Correcting the public asset handling ensures production stability and faster page load times without serverless crashes.

***

# Implementation

## Changes Made
- Added old @tabler icons to src/assets/icons
- Removed 5+ remark callouts files that are not doing anything
