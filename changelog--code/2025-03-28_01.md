# Summary
Integrated mdBook, an open-source Rust-based documentation engine, as a submodule to power our Innovation Cookbook, providing a robust foundation for technical documentation and knowledge sharing.

`mdbook` is the open source tool that powers the Innovation Cookbook. 
`md-cookbook` is the proprietary content that is IN the Innovation Cookbook.

## Why Care
- Leverages battle-tested open-source tooling for documentation
- Separates content from presentation engine
- Enables consistent documentation structure across projects
- Maintains clean separation between open-source tool and proprietary content

## Technical Details

### Architecture Overview
1. **mdBook Integration**
   - Added as a Git submodule tracking upstream directly
   - Maintains separation from other submodules' branching strategy
   - Preserves ability to contribute back to open source

2. **Innovation Cookbook Structure**
   - Built on mdBook's rendering engine
   - Custom templates and themes
   - Organized for innovation documentation
   - Preserves proprietary content separate from engine

### Implementation Notes
- mdBook submodule tracks upstream main branch
- Innovation content lives in separate repository
- Clear separation between engine and content
- Enables independent updates of both components

## Impact and Usage
- **Documentation Team**: Standardized tooling for technical writing
- **Developers**: Familiar Markdown-based workflow
- **Organization**: Clear separation of open source and proprietary content

## Future Considerations
- Monitor mdBook updates for new features
- Consider contributing improvements back to open source
- Evaluate additional mdBook plugins for enhanced functionality
- Keep documentation structure aligned with innovation needs
