contest_setter: Major Update
title: Enhanced Filesystem Observer Specification and Content-Wide Registries
lede: Consolidated filesystem prompts and working code into a single specification. Added a comprehensive draft specification for persistent JSON-based registries to track unique syntax (citations, media, embeds, images) across all markdown files.

## Summary


A new section, "DataStore/Registry Handling for Content-Wide Syntax (Draft Guidance)", was added to the specification [Create-a-Content-Registry-for-Markdown-Files.md]. This section outlines the rationale, principles, and implementation patterns for using persistent JSON registries to track unique content-wide syntax, such as citations, media links, embeds, and images.

### Key Additions
- **Registry Rationale:** Explained why registries are needed for deduplication, analytics, and extensibility.
- **General Principles:** Documented single source of truth, schema-driven validation, atomicity, and idempotency.
- **Example Interfaces:** Provided TypeScript interface examples for citation and media/image registries.
- **Service Pattern:** Described singleton and atomic update patterns for registry services.
- **Implementation Checklist:** Listed concrete steps for integrating registry-backed services into the observer pipeline.
- **Pseudocode:** Added example update flow for registry maintenance.
- **Open Questions:** Raised future-facing questions about batching, concurrency, and audit trails.

### Impact
- Establishes a clear, extensible foundation for all future registry-backed content observation (citations, media, etc.).
- Enables robust, cross-file analytics and prevents data corruption or duplication.
- Promotes best practices for atomic updates and error handling in content registries.

### Next Steps
- Refine this draft as the first registry-backed observer (e.g., citations) is stabilized.
- Extend the guidance to cover new content types as needed.
- Review open questions and iterate on the implementation pattern for concurrency and auditability.

## Summary

The specification for the Filesystem Observer for Consistent Metadata in Markdown files was significantly updated to provide:
- Clearer architectural diagrams and event flow
- Stronger requirements for non-destructive, template-driven, and transparent automation
- A robust, append-only reporting mechanism
- Actionable feedback loops for both developers and content authors
- Explicit guidance for atomic, idempotent updates and error handling

### Key Changes
- **System Pillars:** Now explicitly prohibits YAML libraries for frontmatter parsing, mandates custom parsers, and expands the definition of template-driven consistency.
- **Architecture Overview:** Updated the mermaid diagram to reflect new detection and handling logic.
- **Reporting:** Changed report file handling to be append-only, with period-based aggregation and manual bloat management.
- **Activity Log:** Standardized Obsidian-style backlink syntax for file references in logs.
- **Implementation Guidance:** Emphasized atomic, idempotent file writes, centralized user options, and modular content processors.
- **Error Handling:** Requires all errors, warnings, and changes to be logged and never silently swallowed.
- **Open Questions:** Added new questions about AI code assistant compliance, test suite generation, and guarantees against unintentional changes.

### Impact
- Ensures robust, auditable, and reversible automation for Markdown metadata management
- Provides a clear foundation for extensibility, future registry-backed features, and safe developer collaboration
- Strengthens trust and transparency in content automation workflows

### Next Steps
- Review with development and content teams for further feedback
- Begin implementation of atomic reporting and template-driven processing
- Continue to iterate on registry and test suite guidance
