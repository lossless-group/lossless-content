# Summary
Standardized frontmatter across all 38 essays in the Essays collection, ensuring proper closing delimiters and consistent metadata formatting to support robust content processing.

## Changes Made
- Added proper closing frontmatter delimiters (`---`) to all essay files
- Removed unwanted `changes: [object Object]` lines from frontmatter
- Ensured `date_authored_initial_draft` has the same value as `date_created`
- Fixed serialization of empty arrays and object properties in frontmatter
- Standardized metadata fields across all essays to match the canonical essays template

## Impact
- Improved content processing reliability by ensuring all files have properly formatted frontmatter
- Enhanced content collection consistency with standardized metadata fields
- Prevented parsing errors in Astro content collections due to malformed YAML
- Enabled more reliable automated processing of essay content
