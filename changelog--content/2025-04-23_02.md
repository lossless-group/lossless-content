# Summary
Refined and extended Issue Resolution documentation and workflow files to support robust observer patterns, DRY frontmatter handling, and consistent metadata integration.

## Changes Made
- Updated multiple markdown files in `lost-in-public/issue-resolution/` to clarify observer/watcher implementation steps and success criteria
- Added new file for dynamic route slug generation 404 fix
- Improved frontmatter and metadata for recent issue resolution documents
- Enhanced documentation to emphasize evaluation/reporting over destructive validation

## Impact
- Stronger data integrity and reduced risk of infinite observer loops
- Improved clarity for contributors and maintainers
- Consistent metadata and frontmatter for future automation and reporting

## Documentation
- All changes align with internal observer and data integrity standards
