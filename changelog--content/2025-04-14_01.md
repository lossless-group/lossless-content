# Summary
Updated a large number of existing prompt files across various categories to include a `banner_image` metadata field, generated via an automated script. Added several new workflow prompts and an exploration document related to AI image generation. Added new visual assets.

## Why Care
This update significantly enhances the visual appeal and consistency of the prompt library by adding relevant banner images. The new prompts document key workflows, and the exploration file captures research into generative AI for branding.

# Implementation

## Changes Made
- **New Files Added:**
  - `lost-in-public/explorations/Generative AI for Brand Images.md`: New exploration document.
  - `lost-in-public/prompts/workflow/Ask-Generative-AI-model-to-generate-a-Style.md`: New prompt.
  - `lost-in-public/prompts/workflow/Ask-Local-LLM-to-Generate-Prompts-in-Metadata.md`: New prompt.
  - `lost-in-public/prompts/workflow/Write-an-AI-Model-request-Script.md`: New prompt.
  - Several new images added to `/visuals/` directory (e.g., `Illustration__Creative-Assembly-Line.png`, `pictographOf_AI-Consumer.png`, etc.).
- **Files Modified:**
  - Numerous prompt files within `/content/lost-in-public/prompts/` (across code-style, data-integrity, render-logic, user-interface, workflow subdirectories) were updated to include a `banner_image` field in their YAML frontmatter. See `git status` for the full list.
- **Files Deleted:**
  - `changelog--code/2025-04-13_ReferenceGrid-Layout-Issue.md` (Old code changelog removed).

## Technical Details
- The `banner_image` URLs were generated and injected using the automated script detailed in the corresponding code changelog: `/content/changelog--code/2025-04-14_03.md`.
- Metadata updates preserve existing frontmatter structure and adhere to project standards.

## Integration Points
- All prompts processed by the script now feature a `banner_image` field, providing a consistent visual element.
- The new prompts add to the documented project workflows.
