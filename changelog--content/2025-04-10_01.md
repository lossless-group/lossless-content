# Summary
Added a comprehensive Concepts collection with 103 markdown files covering key conceptual frameworks, methodologies, and design principles used throughout our work. This collection complements the existing Vocabulary terms and creates a more complete reference library.

## Changes Made
- Created `/content/concepts/` directory at the root level
- Added 103 markdown files organized in a hierarchical structure
- Included several subdirectories for related concept groupings:
  - `/content/concepts/CARBS/` (5 files)
  - `/content/concepts/Explainers for Tooling/` (19+ files)
- Integrated with the Astro content collection system via `content.config.ts`
- Ensured consistent formatting and linking between concept documents

## Impact
- Provides a centralized repository of conceptual frameworks and methodologies
- Creates a comprehensive reference system when combined with vocabulary terms
- Supports the `/more-about` route for browsing and accessing concepts
- Establishes foundation for cross-referencing between concepts and vocabulary
- Improves documentation of core organizational thinking and approaches

## Content Structure
The Concepts collection includes files covering:

1. **Methodological Frameworks**:
   - CARBS (Charts, Artifacts, Rituals, Boundaries, Styleguides)
   - Jobs-to-be-Done
   - Divergence and Convergence

2. **Technical Concepts**:
   - API First
   - Abstract Syntax Trees
   - Compostable Architecture
   - Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment

3. **Design Principles**:
   - Conceptual Integrity
   - Abstract to Simplicity
   - Just-Good-Enough

4. **Organizational Approaches**:
   - Developer Experience
   - Data Integrity Rituals
   - Efficiency Before Scale

5. **Tooling Explainers**:
   - Content Management Systems
   - Databases
   - Programming Languages
   - Knowledge Management

## Documentation
- Concepts are accessible through the `/more-about` route
- Each concept can be viewed individually at `/more-about/[concept-name]`
- Concepts are listed collectively at `/more-about/concepts`
- Cross-referenced with vocabulary terms in the reference library
