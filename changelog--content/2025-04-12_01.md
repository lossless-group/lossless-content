# Summary
Standardized frontmatter across the content repository, fixing timestamp and quoted date issues, ensuring consistent author list formatting, and normalizing YAML structure across all content files.

## Changes Made
- Fixed timestamp formatting in date fields, converting all to standard YYYY-MM-DD format
- Removed unnecessary quotes from date fields and other string values
- Standardized author list format to use consistent array notation
- Normalized YAML structure across all content files
- Fixed spelling error in vocabulary file (renamed "Engineering Managemrnt.md" to "Engineering Management.md")
- Created comprehensive issue resolution documentation

### Affected Directories
- `/content/vocabulary/` - 330 files processed, 329 fixed with standardized date format
- `/content/lost-in-public/prompts/` - 50 files with standardized frontmatter
- `/content/tooling/` - Multiple files with fixed frontmatter format
- `/content/lost-in-public/issue-resolution/` - Added new documentation

## Impact
- **Improved Consistency**: All content files now follow the same frontmatter structure
- **Eliminated Observer Errors**: Prevented infinite loop issues in the filesystem observer
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Standardized date format makes content easier to maintain
- **Better Automation**: Consistent YAML structure enables more reliable automation tools

## Technical Details
The standardization was implemented through a series of targeted commits:

1. **Date Formatting Fix**:
   - Removed timestamps (e.g., `2025-04-07T22:42:08.649Z` → `2025-04-07`)
   - Removed quotes from date values (e.g., `'2025-04-07'` → `2025-04-07`)
   - Used the Single Source of Truth `formatDate` utility from `tidyverse/observers/utils/commonUtils.ts`

2. **Author List Standardization**:
   - Converted all author formats to consistent array notation:
   ```yaml
   authors:
     - Author Name
   ```

3. **YAML Structure Normalization**:
   - Ensured consistent indentation
   - Standardized array notation for tags and other list fields
   - Removed unnecessary quotes from string values

## Documentation
- Created detailed issue resolution document at `/content/lost-in-public/issue-resolution/2025-04-11_Frontmatter--Date-formatting-fix.md`
- Updated Map of Relevant Paths with critical path structure warnings
- Added lessons learned about YAML library limitations and proper frontmatter handling

## Implementation Tools
- Created and used a custom script at `tidyverse/observers/scripts/fix-date-timestamps.ts`
- Implemented regex-based frontmatter parsing to replace YAML libraries
- Used git commit hooks to ensure consistent formatting
