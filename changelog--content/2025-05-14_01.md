# Summary
Created a comprehensive specification for integrating backend data stores for dynamic content and documented existing debugging conventions to ensure consistent implementation across the project.

## Changes Made
- Created new specifications 
   - Backend data stores integration with phased implementation approach
   - Debugging conventions
   - CSS and Tailwind Theme managment conventions
- Documented existing markdown and AST debugging system for reuse in future implementations
- Updated reporting conventions documentation
- Added success criteria for Phase 1 implementation of citation registry
- Created implementation prompt for the first phase of backend data store integration
- Ran Recraft and ImageKit scripts to generate images for new specification, prompt, and reminder on debugging conventions.

## Technical Details
- Defined data model for citation registry with both minimal and comprehensive field lists
- Documented debugging system components including MarkdownDebugger and AstDebugger
- Added flow diagram for citation processing pipeline
- Established activation methods for debugging through environment variables and URL parameters
- Provided code snippets for debugging implementation

## Integration Points
- Connected specification to implementation prompt for Phase 1
- Linked debugging conventions to existing code in site submodule
- Established reporting conventions for new data persistence features
- Created reference to existing citation processing code
