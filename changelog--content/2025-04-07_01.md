# Summary
Implemented comprehensive frontmatter consistency improvements across the content repository, affecting over 950 tooling files, and added detailed documentation for the OpenGraph screenshot URL fetching feature.

## Changes Made

### Frontmatter Consistency Updates
- Applied frontmatter validation and normalization to approximately 950 files in the tooling directory:
  - Added missing required fields (e.g., `date_created`, `date_modified`)
  - Converted kebab-case properties to snake_case
  - Normalized tag formatting to YAML bullet list syntax
  - Ensured consistent structure across all content files
  - Preserved existing frontmatter values while applying templates

### New Session Logs
- Added detailed session logs documenting the implementation and testing of the filesystem observer and OpenGraph integration:
  - `lost-in-public/sessions/2025-04-07_01.md` - Documenting the filesystem observer for frontmatter consistency
  - `lost-in-public/sessions/2025-04-07_02.md` - Documenting the OpenGraph screenshot URL fetching enhancement
  - `lost-in-public/sessions/2025-04-04_01.md` and `2025-04-04_02.md` - Earlier implementation discussions
  - `lost-in-public/sessions/2025-04-06_03.md` - Additional implementation details

### Updated Prompts
- Enhanced `lost-in-public/prompts/workflow/Write-a-Code-Changelog-Entry.md` with clearer file location and naming instructions:
  - Added absolute and relative directory paths
  - Improved filename format explanation with examples
  - Added explicit instructions for determining sequential numbering

### New Prompts
- Added new prompts for data integrity features:
  - `lost-in-public/prompts/data-integrity/Integrate-OpenGraph-Fetch-into-Observer.md`
  - `lost-in-public/prompts/data-integrity/Use-Filesystem-Observer-to-Assert-Frontmatter-Updated.md`

### Generated Reports
- Added 38 frontmatter observer reports documenting the validation and processing of content files:
  - Reports show statistics on files processed, validation errors, and OpenGraph data fetching
  - Reports provide insights into the effectiveness of the frontmatter observer system

### Code Changelog Entries
- Added code changelog entries documenting the implementation details:
  - `changelog--code/2025-04-06_03.md`
  - `changelog--code/2025-04-07_01.md`
  - `changelog--code/2025-04-07_02.md`

## Impact
- Significantly improved content consistency across the entire repository
- Automated frontmatter validation reduces manual errors and enforces standards
- Improved documentation ensures better knowledge transfer and project continuity
- Session logs provide detailed context for understanding the implementation decisions
- Updated prompts enhance clarity and reduce potential errors in workflow
- Generated reports provide evidence of the system's effectiveness and identify areas for improvement

## Documentation
- The session logs serve as comprehensive documentation of the implementation process
- The updated prompts provide clear guidelines for future changelog entries
- The observer reports offer insights into the system's performance and effectiveness
