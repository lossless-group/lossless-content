# Content Changelog: Major Updates to Prompts Library & YAML Automation

## Summary
This changelog documents a comprehensive set of updates to the `lost-in-public/prompts` content library, including:
- Automated reporting and correction of YAML frontmatter properties
- Addition, renaming, and removal of prompt files
- Enhanced data integrity and documentation standards

## Notable Changes

### 1. **New & Updated Prompts**
- Added: `workflow/Report-on-YAML-Idiosyncracies.md` — New prompt for reporting YAML inconsistencies and missing properties.
- Updated: Multiple prompts in `code-style/`, `data-integrity/`, `render-logic/`, `user-interface/`, and `workflow/` to improve YAML compliance and documentation.
- Renamed: `data-integrity/Merge-Matching-Files-to-Improve-YAML.md` → `Merge-Matching-Files-to-Add-YAML.md`

### 2. **Deletions & Cleanups**
- Deleted: `render-logic/Code-Block-Rendering-System.md` and `workflow/Full-Width-Separator-Issue-Resolution.md` (deprecated or consolidated).

### 3. **YAML Frontmatter & Automation**
- Ran automated scripts to:
  - Report on missing `image_prompt` and `banner_image` properties
  - Add or update `banner_image` properties using the Recraft API (where missing)
  - Standardize and validate YAML keys and formatting
- Improved automation and reporting for data integrity and content consistency.
