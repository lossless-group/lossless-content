# Summary
Added three new prompt documents to guide component architecture, styling approaches, and dynamic routing implementation in the Astro-based site. These prompts establish best practices for component refactoring, CSS architecture, and content rendering.

## Changes Made
- Created three new prompt documents in the `/content/lost-in-public/prompts/` directory:
  - `code-style/Move-Functionality-and-Style-to-Specific-Components.md`
  - `code-style/Move-Styles-from-Tailwind-to-CSS-using-our-Styles.md`
  - `render-logic/Integrate-Concepts-into-More-About.md`
- Established guidelines for component-based architecture
- Documented approach for transitioning from Tailwind to semantic CSS
- Provided implementation details for integrating concepts collection into dynamic routing

## Impact
- **Improved Code Organization**: Established patterns for component refactoring and organization
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Documented approach for moving from utility classes to semantic CSS
- **Expanded Content Access**: Created framework for rendering concepts alongside vocabulary
- **Standardized Implementation**: Provided reference documentation for future similar tasks
- **Consistent Architecture**: Ensured component and styling approaches follow project standards

## Content Details

### 1. Move-Functionality-and-Style-to-Specific-Components.md
This prompt outlines the approach for refactoring page-level component rendering into dedicated component files:

- **Objective**: Move vocabulary and concept rendering from page files to dedicated components
- **Target Components**: 
  - `@components/reference/VocabularyPreviewCard.astro`
  - `@components/reference/ConceptPreviewCard.astro`
- **Implementation Status**: Completed and implemented

### 2. Move-Styles-from-Tailwind-to-CSS-using-our-Styles.md
This prompt establishes guidelines for transitioning from Tailwind utility classes to component-specific CSS:

- **Context**: Moving away from inline Tailwind classes toward a more maintainable CSS architecture
- **Approach**: 
  - Using semantic BEM-style class naming
  - Leveraging project CSS variables
  - Adding comprehensive comments
  - Maintaining consistent styling patterns
- **Implementation Status**: Applied to reference components

### 3. Integrate-Concepts-into-More-About.md
This prompt documents the implementation of dynamic routing for the concepts collection:

- **Objective**: Render `content/concepts` markdown files through the same `/more-about` dynamic router used for vocabulary
- **Key Components**: 
  - Dynamic route handler using catch-all pattern
  - Index pages for browsing collections
  - Title generation from filenames
  - Consistent styling across collections
- **Implementation Status**: Fully implemented and documented

## Documentation
- Implementation details are documented in the respective prompt files
- Code changes are tracked in the code changelog: `content/changelog--code/2025-04-12_03.md`
- The concepts collection is documented in: `content/changelog--content/2025-04-10_01.md`
