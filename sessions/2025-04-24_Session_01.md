# Goal:
Build on our work rendering Mermaid Charts in Markdown. End up with MULTIPLE mermaid charts from a single markdown file rendering in the correct location in the HTML output. Create a custom component that can create a jumbo view of the mermaid chart, popping out of the parent width. Create an expand button on that mermaid component that expands the chart to full screen, then toggle the button to collapse the chart back to the original size.



# Session Highlights
- Merged feature branches (`feature/md-citations` into `feature/mermaid-charts`) using a temp branch and resolved all conflicts with clear, DRY, and human-readable merges.
- Fixed TypeScript typing issues in AstroMarkdown components, ensuring robust support for Markdown AST nodes (e.g., footnote references).
- Continued enhancement of dynamic content routing, ToolCard self-sufficiency, and toolkit URL generation for scalable content collections.
- Maintained aggressive, comprehensive commenting and DRY principles throughout code changes.
- Updated technical specifications and changelog documentation for new features and infrastructure improvements.

#### VERBATIM DIALOG

Here’s how I would approach this as a product manager, following the iterative improvement workflow and considering your engineering team’s needs, the project’s coding standards, and the explicit context provided in your prompt files.

---
## Step 1: Review the User Prompt and Current State

- **Prompt to Improve:**  
  [[Handle-Mermaid-Codeblocks-in-Astro.md](cci:7://file:///Users/mpstaton/code/lost-in-public/prompts/render-logic/Handle-Mermaid-Codeblocks-in-Astro.md:0:0-0:0)](../render-logic/Handle-Mermaid-Codeblocks-in-Astro.md)  
  This prompt describes the goal of rendering multiple Mermaid charts per Markdown file in Astro, refactoring into a dedicated component, and enabling debugging and full-screen features.

- **Relevant Files/Components:**  
  - `site/src/layouts/OneArticle.astro`
  - `site/src/components/articles/OneArticleOnPage.astro`
  - `site/src/components/articles/AstroMarkdown.astro`
  - `site/astro.config.mjs`
  - (To be created) `site/src/components/articles/MermaidChart.astro`

- **Success Criteria:**  
  1. Debug mode for the Markdown pipeline.
  2. Multiple Mermaid codeblocks render correctly.
  3. Mermaid rendering logic is refactored into its own component.
  4. The system renders a specific spec file through the dynamic page.

---

## Step 2: Identify Gaps & Opportunities for Iteration

**Gaps/Opportunities in the Prompt:**
- The prompt is clear about the “what” but could be more actionable for engineers and AI assistants.  
- It doesn’t specify:
  - How to identify and extract Mermaid codeblocks in the Markdown AST.
  - How the new `MermaidChart.astro` should be structured (props, slots, event handling, accessibility).
  - How to wire up debug mode, and what debug output should look like.
  - How to test that multiple Mermaid charts render in the correct order/position.
  - Acceptance criteria for the expand/collapse/fullscreen UX.

---

## Step 3: Iterative Improvement of the Prompt

### Improved Prompt: Handle Mermaid Codeblocks in Astro

---

#### Objective

Enable robust, scalable rendering of multiple Mermaid charts per Markdown file in the Astro site, using a dedicated, reusable component and supporting advanced UX (expand/fullscreen) and developer debug tooling.

---

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Refactor Rendering Pipeline:**
   - In `AstroMarkdown.astro`, detect codeblocks with `lang="mermaid"` in the Markdown AST.
   - Replace each Mermaid codeblock node with a `<MermaidChart code={...} />` component instance, preserving order and context.
   - Ensure fallback/error handling for malformed Mermaid code.

2. **Create `MermaidChart.astro` Component:**
   - Accepts at minimum a `code: string` prop.
   - Renders the Mermaid diagram using the configured rehype plugin or a direct Mermaid.js integration.
   - Implements an expand/collapse button:
     - Expands the chart to full width or fullscreen.
     - Button toggles between “Expand” and “Collapse.”
     - Accessible for keyboard and screen readers.
   - Supports multiple charts per page, each independently expandable.

3. **Debug Mode:**
   - Add a `debug` boolean prop (or global debug flag).
   - When enabled, output the Markdown AST and/or Mermaid codeblocks at each pipeline stage (raw, parsed, rendered).
   - Render debug output in a clearly styled container above/below the article.

4. **Testing and Acceptance:**
   - Use a test Markdown file with at least 3 Mermaid codeblocks in different locations (top, middle, bottom).
   - Confirm all charts render in correct order and position.
   - Confirm expand/collapse UX works for each chart independently.
   - Confirm debug output is informative and non-intrusive.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Comment all new/modified code per project standards.
   - Update the technical spec and changelog.

---

#### Success Criteria

- [ ] Debug mode can be toggled and shows pipeline output.
- [ ] Multiple Mermaid charts render in correct locations for a single Markdown file.
- [ ] `MermaidChart.astro` is modular, accessible, and fully documented.
- [ ] Expand/collapse works per chart, with smooth UX.
- [ ] The spec file renders correctly via the dynamic route.

#### VERBATIM CASCADE DIALOG

Absolutely—switching to developer mode per your project workflow.

### Step 1: Review the Prompt

I have carefully read the prompt at  
`content/lost-in-public/prompts/render-logic/Handle-Mermaid-Codeblocks-in-Astro.md`  
It outlines:
- The need to robustly identify and extract Mermaid codeblocks from the Markdown AST.
- Refactoring rendering so each Mermaid codeblock is handled by a dedicated `MermaidChart.astro` component.
- Ensuring multiple Mermaid charts per file render in correct order and location.
- Adding a debug mode to inspect the AST at each stage.
- Success criteria for implementation and integration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Current Implementation

#### What’s Working Well
- **Pipeline Structure:**  
  The rendering pipeline leverages Astro’s layouts and components (`OneArticle.astro`, `OneArticleOnPage.astro`, `AstroMarkdown.astro`), which is modular and aligns with best practices.
- **Prompt Clarity:**  
  The prompt now includes explicit extraction logic for Mermaid codeblocks, with sample AST traversal code and references to remark/unified/rehype best practices.
- **Componentization:**  
  The plan to move Mermaid rendering into a dedicated `MermaidChart.astro` component is sound, supporting DRYness and future extensibility (expand/collapse UX, accessibility, etc.).
- **Debugging:**  
  The prompt calls for a debug mode that can output ASTs and transformation stages, which is critical for rapid iteration and troubleshooting.

#### Potential Gaps or Points of Caution
- **Current Extraction:**  
  The prompt provides the correct approach for AST traversal, but it’s not yet clear if the current implementation (in `AstroMarkdown.astro` or any custom remark/rehype plugin) actually replaces Mermaid codeblocks with a custom component, or just renders them as plain code.
- **Component Integration:**  
  If the pipeline currently outputs raw codeblocks, there may be a need to:
    - Add a custom remark/rehype plugin (or extend the existing pipeline) to replace Mermaid codeblocks with a placeholder/component node.
    - Ensure Astro’s rendering pipeline can handle these custom nodes and render the correct component at runtime.
- **Multiple Codeblocks:**  
  There may be edge cases if Mermaid codeblocks are nested in lists, blockquotes, or other containers—ensure the traversal and replacement logic is robust.
- **Debug Mode:**  
  The debug mode’s plumbing (how to enable, where output appears, what is shown) should be clearly documented and easy to toggle for both local and production debugging.
- **Testing:**  
  The success criteria call for a test file with multiple Mermaid codeblocks. If this does not exist yet, it should be created to validate the implementation.

#### Next Steps
1. **Audit the current `AstroMarkdown.astro` and any markdown plugins** to determine if:
    - Mermaid codeblocks are being detected and replaced with a component.
    - The debug mode is wired up and outputs the AST at each stage.
2. **If not:**  
    - Implement a custom remark/rehype plugin or extend the AstroMarkdown logic to do this replacement.
    - Build the `MermaidChart.astro` component (if not present) with minimal props and placeholder rendering.
    - Add a debug toggle and ensure AST output is visible and useful.
3. **Test with a Markdown file containing multiple Mermaid codeblocks** to ensure correct rendering and debug output.

**Would you like me to immediately audit the current `AstroMarkdown.astro` and supporting pipeline code to confirm the above, or proceed directly to implementation?**

Understood—no need to focus on automated tests at this stage, as you will visually verify the target page in the browser and a test suite does not exist yet.

**Key implications for implementation:**
- Prioritize robust, observable in-browser behavior and clear debug output.
- Ensure the debug mode is easily toggled and outputs the AST/codeblock extraction results where you can see them in the browser.
- Focus on making the pipeline and component integration work for live content, rather than writing automated assertions.

**Next step:**  
I will now audit the current implementation in `AstroMarkdown.astro` (and any related markdown pipeline logic) to:
- Confirm how codeblocks are currently rendered.
- Determine if Mermaid codeblocks are being detected and replaced with a component, or just rendered as plain code.
- Identify exactly where to insert or modify logic to enable the new behavior per the prompt.

Let me proceed to review the relevant code in `AstroMarkdown.astro` and the markdown rendering pipeline.

Here is my analysis of the current implementation in `AstroMarkdown.astro` and the markdown pipeline, with a focus on Mermaid codeblock handling:

---

## **Current State Analysis: AstroMarkdown.astro**

### 1. **How Codeblocks Are Rendered**
- The following code is used for code nodes:
  ```astro
  {(node.type === "code") &&
    <BaseCodeblock code={node.value} lang={node.lang ?? 'text'} />
  }
  ```
- This means **all code blocks**, regardless of language, are rendered with the `BaseCodeblock` component. There is no special handling for `lang === "mermaid"`.

### 2. **Implications**
- **Mermaid codeblocks are currently rendered as plain code** (syntax highlighted, but not as diagrams).
- There is **no logic to detect `lang: "mermaid"` and swap in a `<MermaidChart />` component**.
- There is no evidence of a custom remark/rehype plugin or pre-processing step that would transform Mermaid codeblocks into a different node/component.

### 3. **Debugging and Observability**
- There is a robust debug pipeline (`DebugMarkdown.astro`) that can output ASTs at various stages.
- This is helpful for verifying that codeblock nodes are present and correctly structured, but does not affect rendering.

### 4. **Componentization**
- The codebase is structured to allow per-node-type component overrides, so **adding a new case for Mermaid codeblocks is straightforward and idiomatic**.

---

## **Conclusion & Next Steps**

### **What Needs to Change**
- **Add a conditional in AstroMarkdown.astro:**  
  When `node.type === "code" && node.lang === "mermaid"`, render a `<MermaidChart code={node.value} />` instead of `<BaseCodeblock />`.
- **Create the `MermaidChart.astro` component** if it does not exist, with at least a `code` prop and placeholder rendering.
- **(Optional but recommended)**:  
  - Add a debug prop or global toggle to `MermaidChart.astro` for easier troubleshooting.
  - Ensure the debug pipeline can show the extraction and replacement of Mermaid codeblocks.

### **No Automated Tests Required**
- As per your direction, focus on in-browser verification—no test suite or automated assertions are needed.

---

**Ready to proceed:**  
Would you like me to implement the conditional rendering and create a starter `MermaidChart.astro` component now? If so, I will:
- Update `AstroMarkdown.astro` to use `<MermaidChart />` for Mermaid codeblocks.
- Create a minimal `MermaidChart.astro` component scaffold (with strong comments and debug support).
- Ensure all code is commented and DRY, per your standards.

Let me know if you want to proceed with this implementation!

Here’s a detailed technical analysis of your current render pipeline and the “when/where” problem for integrating Mermaid diagram rendering:

---

## **Current Render Pipeline (from OneArticle.astro)**

1. **Markdown Preprocessing**
   - `interpolateMermaidVariables()` preprocesses the raw Markdown, interpolating variables inside Mermaid codeblocks. This is a string-level operation.

2. **MDAST Generation**
   - `unified()` with `remarkParse`, `remarkGfm`, `remarkImages`, `remarkBacklinks`, and `remarkCitations` parses the Markdown into an MDAST (Markdown AST).
   - `processor.parse()` and `processor.run()` produce the transformed MDAST.

3. **HTML Generation (with Mermaid)**
   - A **separate pipeline** runs:
     - `remarkParse` → `remarkRehype` → `rehypeMermaid` → `rehypeStringify`
   - This pipeline takes the Markdown and outputs HTML, with Mermaid codeblocks converted to `<svg>...</svg>` by `rehypeMermaid`.

4. **Mermaid SVG Extraction**
   - After HTML is generated, a regex extracts all `<svg>...</svg>` blocks (the rendered Mermaid diagrams) into an array.

5. **Rendering**
   - The extracted SVGs are rendered in a `<section class="mermaid-blocks">` before the main content.
   - The main content is rendered by the `Component` prop, which receives the transformed MDAST and the compiled HTML.

---

## **Key Technical Observations**

- **Mermaid SVGs are rendered independently of the main Markdown content.**
  - This means Mermaid diagrams are always grouped together at the top (or wherever the block is placed), not inline where the codeblock appeared in the original Markdown.
  - The rest of the Markdown is rendered using your normal MDAST → Astro component pipeline, with codeblocks rendered as `<BaseCodeblock />`.

- **rehypeMermaid only works at the HAST (HTML AST) stage.**
  - It expects to receive HAST nodes, not MDAST nodes.
  - If you want to replace Mermaid codeblocks inline, you need to let the rehype pipeline run, but also preserve the mapping between original codeblock position and the generated SVG.

- **You cannot simply “catch” Mermaid codeblocks in the MDAST and replace them with a component, because the diagram SVG is not available until after `rehypeMermaid` runs.**
  - If you swap in a `<MermaidChart />` component at the MDAST stage, you’d have to re-render the diagram on the client (using Mermaid.js in the browser), or re-run the mermaid rendering logic in your component.

---

## **Options for Correct Inline Rendering**

### **Option 1: Client-Side Rendering with Mermaid.js**
- At the MDAST stage, detect `code` nodes with `lang: "mermaid"` and replace them with a `<MermaidChart code={...} />` component.
- The `MermaidChart` component loads Mermaid.js in the browser and renders the diagram client-side.
- **Pros:** Preserves correct inline positioning. Works with Astro’s component pipeline. Allows for expand/collapse, debug, etc.
- **Cons:** Diagrams are not pre-rendered on the server; may have FOUC (flash of unstyled content) or slower render for large/complex diagrams.

### **Option 2: Custom Plugin to Inline SVGs at the HAST Stage**
- Write a custom plugin that:
  - Runs after `rehypeMermaid` and before `rehypeStringify`.
  - Finds `<svg>` elements generated by Mermaid and replaces the corresponding codeblock node with the SVG, preserving position.
- **Pros:** Diagrams are server-rendered and inline, no client-side Mermaid.js required.
- **Cons:** More complex to maintain; must ensure mapping between codeblock and SVG is robust.

### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
- At the MDAST stage, tag Mermaid codeblocks for special handling (e.g., add a custom property).
- In the HAST pipeline, after `rehypeMermaid`, walk the HAST and replace placeholder nodes with the generated SVGs.
- **Pros:** Flexible, can support fallback to client-side rendering if server-side fails.

---

## **Summary and Recommendation**

- **Your current approach isolates Mermaid rendering from the rest of the Markdown pipeline, so diagrams are not inline.**
- **To render diagrams inline (in the correct spot), you must either:**
  - Render diagrams client-side in a `<MermaidChart />` component (easy, flexible, but client-only).
  - Or, inject the SVGs into the correct place in the HAST after server-side rendering (more complex, but server-rendered).

**Given your project’s modular, DRY, and debuggable philosophy, I recommend:**
- **Client-side rendering via a `<MermaidChart />` component for maximum flexibility and debugging.**
  - This lets you add expand/collapse, debug props, and custom error handling easily.
  - You can revisit server-side SVG injection later if SEO or static rendering is critical.

---

**Would you like me to proceed with the client-side `<MermaidChart />` component approach, or help you design a custom plugin to inline SVGs at the HAST stage?**  
Let me know your preferred direction and I’ll implement accordingly!

Here’s how to implement **Option 3: The Hybrid Approach** for robust, inline Mermaid rendering in Astro:

---

## **Hybrid Approach: Tag and Replace**

### **Step 1: Tag Mermaid Codeblocks in MDAST**

- During the MDAST (Markdown AST) processing stage, traverse the AST.
- For each `code` node with `lang: "mermaid"`, add a custom property (e.g., `node.isMermaid = true` or `node.data = { ...node.data, isMermaid: true }`).
- Optionally, replace the codeblock with a placeholder node (e.g., a custom `mermaidPlaceholder` type, or a `div` with a unique ID).

**Example:**
```js
visit(tree, 'code', node => {
  if (node.lang === 'mermaid') {
    node.data = { ...(node.data || {}), isMermaid: true, id: generateUniqueId() };
  }
});
```

### **Step 2: Pass Through to HAST and rehypeMermaid**

- Continue the pipeline:  
  - MDAST → remarkRehype → HAST
  - rehypeMermaid will convert Mermaid codeblocks to `<svg>` diagrams, but only if they are still codeblocks at this stage.

### **Step 3: Replace Placeholders with SVGs in HAST**

- After `rehypeMermaid` runs, walk the HAST tree:
  - For each node that matches your placeholder (e.g., a `div` with a unique ID, or a node with a matching `data` property), replace it with the corresponding SVG node generated by rehypeMermaid.
  - This preserves the **inline position** of each Mermaid diagram.

**Example (pseudo-code):**
```js
visit(hast, 'element', node => {
  if (node.properties && node.properties['data-mermaid-id']) {
    // Find the SVG generated for this ID
    const svg = findSvgForId(node.properties['data-mermaid-id']);
    if (svg) {
      Object.assign(node, svg);
    }
  }
});
```

### **Step 4: Fallback to Client-Side Rendering (Optional)**

- If the SVG cannot be generated (e.g., server-side error), you can:
  - Leave the placeholder in the output.
  - Use a `<MermaidChart />` component to render the diagram client-side as a fallback.

---

## **Pros of This Approach**

- **Inline diagrams**: Mermaid SVGs appear exactly where the original codeblock was.
- **Server-rendered by default**: Good for SEO, print, and static export.
- **Flexible**: You can add debug info, fallback to client-side rendering, or add custom UI (expand/collapse, error states).

---

## **Implementation Notes**

- You’ll need to maintain a mapping between codeblocks (by unique ID or order) and their rendered SVGs.
- Use robust AST traversal libraries (`unist-util-visit`, `hast-util-visit`) to manipulate trees.
- Comment every transformation step and maintain DRY, single-source-of-truth logic for codeblock handling.

---

**If you want, I can draft the code for:**
- Tagging Mermaid codeblocks in the MDAST.
- A HAST plugin to replace placeholders with SVGs after `rehypeMermaid`.
- A fallback to client-side rendering if SVG is missing.

Let me know if you’d like to proceed with this implementation, or if you want to see a specific part of the pipeline in detail!
