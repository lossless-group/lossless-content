# AI Toolkit Overview

The AI Toolkit represents the cutting edge of artificial intelligence tools and frameworks that are reshaping software development, content creation, and knowledge work.

## Key Categories

### AI Models
Large language models, speech-to-text systems, computer vision models, and specialized AI capabilities that power modern applications.

### Code Generators & AI Assistants
Tools that leverage AI to write, review, and improve code. These range from IDE integrations to standalone code generation platforms.

### AI Interfaces & Workspaces
Platforms and environments designed for working with AI models, including chat interfaces, prompt engineering tools, and AI-powered workspaces.

### Model Producers & Platforms
Companies and platforms that train, fine-tune, and deploy AI models at scale.

## Why This Matters

AI tools are fundamentally changing how we:
- Write and review code
- Generate and transform content
- Understand complex systems
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Learn new technologies

## Getting Started

If you're new to the AI toolkit ecosystem, start with:
1. Understanding the different types of AI models
2. Exploring code generators for your development environment
3. Learning prompt engineering techniques
4. Experimenting with local vs. cloud-based solutions
