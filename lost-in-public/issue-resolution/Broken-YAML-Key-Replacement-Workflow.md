# What were we trying to do and why

We needed to batch-replace the `banner_image` key with `portrait_image` in the YAML frontmatter of all Markdown files in `content/lost-in-public/prompts/`. This was required to align with updated content conventions and to prevent breakages in downstream processing and rendering.

# Incorrect Attempts and the Problem

- The script (`convertKeyNamesInYAML.cjs`) was run repeatedly and reported that files were corrected, but **no actual replacements were made in the Markdown files**.
- The script logic only matched `banner_image:` if it appeared at the very start of the line (after `.trim()`), so it missed indented, quoted, or otherwise valid YAML forms of the key.
- Critically, even when a match was found and a replacement was made in memory, the script **did not write the modified content back to disk**. The result: the frontmatter in all files remained unchanged, despite the script's output claiming otherwise.

# "Aha!" Moment

- Realized that the script's `convertKeyNames` function returned the corrected content, but the main workflow never wrote it back to the file system.
- Also realized the matching logic needed to be robust to all YAML-valid key forms (quotes, spaces, indentation).

# Final Solution

1. **Patched the matching logic** to use a regex that matches any YAML-valid `banner_image` key (handles quotes, indentation, and spacing).
2. **Patched the main workflow** to write the corrected content back to the file if a change was made.
3. **Re-ran the script** and verified that all Markdown files were actually updated on disk, and the report accurately reflected the changes.

## Key Code Snippet (Write-Back Logic)
```js
const results = await Promise.all(markdownFiles.map(async (markdownFilePath) => {
    const markdownContent = fs.readFileSync(markdownFilePath, 'utf8');
    const result = await convertKeyNames(markdownContent, markdownFilePath);
    if (result.modified && result.content) {
        fs.writeFileSync(markdownFilePath, result.content, 'utf8');
    }
    return result;
}));
```

# Lessons for Future Issue Resolution

- Always verify that a script making content changes actually writes those changes to disk.
- Always test regexes for YAML key matching against real-world, messy data.
- Never trust a script's output until you confirm the actual files are changed.
- Add logging for every file actually modified.
