# Big Ideas

1. Churn: New kind of content management (Think what we've been doing.)
2. Frapiture: Capture Screen and Screencast Stream and Backup
3. Changelog.ai: Headless Changelog management, generate Changelog from Git Commits, load into beautiful changelogs that can be customized
4. ComingGoingWent: Headless CMS for networked organizations that are running around the world.
5. Taxonify: Taxonomy management for content. Graph-based relationships, variants, contextual search. 

# Little Wins for the Website
1. Fix the tags, design landing pages for tags. 
2. Create the MediHacks project landing page. 
3. Presentation Directives fix. Astro presentation rendering, Markdown presentation rendering, no matter. 

# Big Possibilities for the Website
1. Changelog by Project architecture.
