# USER GOAL:

Finish introducing the "Issue Resolution" collection to the observer system by implementing a watcher.

### Working Directory
> `content/lost-in-public/issue-resolution`

## STEPS:

### Step 1: Audit the Metadata

1. Read the rest of this file for the context window.
2. Systematically audit the metadata of each file within the `content/lost-in-public/issue-resolution` directory. For each file:
    a. Parse its frontmatter.
    b. Compare its structure against the expected pattern for 'Issue Resolution' items (refer to the `tidyverse/observers/templates/issue-resolution.ts` template for the expected structure and the "Ideal Data Example for Issue Resolution" section below).
    c. Log any identified inconsistencies, errors, or missing mandatory fields.
    Proceed through all files without requiring intermediate confirmation for each.

### Step 2: Understand the Patterns and Architecture of the Observer and Watcher System

1. Read the other watcher files in `tidyverse/observers/watchers` to understand the pattern, including the imported handlers, utils and services.
2. Read the master orchestration in `tidyverse/observers/index.ts`, `tidyverse/observers/userOptionsConfig.ts`, and `tidyverse/observers/fileSystemObserver.ts` to understand the pattern, including separation of concerns, DRY principles, and the use of the propertyCollector.
3. Read the starter files previously created in `tidyverse/observers/templates/issue-resolution.ts`

4. **Visualize the Flow:** The following diagram illustrates how the new `issueResolutionWatcher.ts` will integrate into the existing observer system:

   ```mermaid
   graph TD
       subgraph IssueResolutionWatcher Integration
           A[File Event in 'content/lost-in-public/issue-resolution'] --> B(FileSystemObserver);
           B --> C{PropertyCollector Check};
           C --> D[issueResolutionWatcher.ts];
           D --> E[Read 'issue-resolution.ts' Template];
           D --> F[Process Frontmatter (yamlFrontmatter.ts)];
           F --> G[Apply Handlers (e.g., addSiteUUID.ts)];
           G --> H[Write Updated File];
       end
   ```

5. **Understand the Target Data Structure (Ideal Data Example for Issue Resolution):**
   The goal of the watcher is to ensure that frontmatter for 'Issue Resolution' items is consistent and complete. Here's an example of an ideal, fully processed frontmatter for an item in the `content/lost-in-public/issue-resolution` directory:

   ```yaml
   ---
   title: 'Specific Issue Title'
   lede: 'Short description of the issue and its resolution.'
   status: 'Resolved' # Expected values: 'Reported', 'Investigating', 'Pending-Fix', 'Resolved', 'Wont-Fix'
   date_reported: YYYY-MM-DD
   date_resolved: YYYY-MM-DD # (nullable if not resolved)
   affected_systems: ['System A', 'Module B'] # (array of strings, optional)
   severity: 'Medium' # Expected values: 'Low', 'Medium', 'High', 'Critical' (optional)
   resolution_summary: 'Key steps taken to resolve the issue, or current status.'
   tags: ['bug-fix', 'database', 'specific-module'] # (standard tags)
   site_uuid: 'auto-generated-uuid-12345' # (auto-generated by addSiteUUID.ts handler)
   # Add any other fields defined in tidyverse/observers/templates/issue-resolution.ts
   ---
   ```
   Refer to `tidyverse/observers/templates/issue-resolution.ts` for the canonical template definition.

6. Suggest the best way to implement a watcher for the issue resolution collection.

### Step 3: Implement the Plan

0. **Define Key Characteristics for `issueResolutionWatcher.ts`:**
   Before coding, clarify the following for the new watcher:
    *   **Input:**
        *   `filePath`: string (absolute path to the changed file)
        *   `fileContent`: string (content of the file)
        *   `frontmatter`: object (parsed frontmatter from the file)
        *   `dirConfig`: object (the specific configuration for the 'issue-resolution' directory from `userOptionsConfig.ts`)
    *   **Primary Logic:**
        *   Validate and conform `frontmatter` against `tidyverse/observers/templates/issue-resolution.ts`.
        *   Apply relevant handlers (e.g., `addSiteUUID.ts`, and potentially others specific to issue resolution if needed).
    *   **Output:**
        *   Object containing the `updatedFrontmatter` (object) and `updatedFileContent` (string) if changes were made.
        *   Return `null` or an equivalent indicator if no changes are necessary.
    *   **Side Effects:**
        *   Logs its processing activity clearly.
        *   Interacts with the `propertyCollector` to register expected changes and prevent loops.

1. Implement the plan. 
2. Test the implementation focused on the "issue resolution" collection subsystem on the `content/lost-in-public/issue-resolution` directory.  
3. Run all the subsystems at once to see if they work together.

# The Observer System

This document provides instructions for augmenting, improving, or running the filesystem observer to process new files within specified directories that contain a unique content collection for rendering on the website.

## Previous Mistakes:

- *Infinite Loops*: The observer was triggering itself, leading to an infinite loop. This was resolved by adding a universal "propertyCollector" in the main observer, which then delegates all tasks to the appropriate watchers, handlers, services, and utils. The propertyCollector immediately receives an "expectation" object, which is a list of properties that will be created or modified by the watchers, handlers, services, and utils. The propertyCollector also includes a cooldown period and an in-memory log of files that have been processed.

- *Random Frontmatter Corruption*: When introducing new functionality to the observer system, functionality that had already been honed and was error free would be duplicated for convenience of Code Generation and reasoning within one file. But, the use of regular expressions and text manipulation to extract, evaluate, generate and update frontmatter created inconsistencies, and sometimes glaring errors that corrupted entire directories of content, which then needed to be fixed.  We have MAINLY solved for this by using DRY principles and keeping extraction, evaluation, and update logic in a single-source-of-truth that is used by all watchers, handlers, services, and utils. IT IS CRITICAL TO FOLLOW THIS PRINCIPLE AND NOT UNNECESSARILY DUPLICATE FRONTMATTER TRANSFORMATION LOGIC ACROSS FILES.

## Integrated Observer System

### Independent Watchers for Collections
> `tidyverse/observers/watchers`
We decided to avoid repeating a monolithic FileSystemObserver that handles all collections. There were several key moments where one collection was being corrupted by the monolithic observer, and it was not possible to isolate the issue. We would then need to move the `fileSystemObserver` file to the archive, and start from scratch. 

So, instead, we will have independent watchers for each collection. This involves repeating a number of functions across separate watcher files, but it is a necessary evil to ensure that each collection is processed correctly. And if there is a glitch for one collection, the remaining watchers can stay active in the observer.

## Unique Collections or Observers

### Tooling and Toolkit

While other collections are rendered as articles in content layouts, the "toolCollection" or "toolingCollection" is rendered as a Card Crid, with visually rich cards displaying the tools and their metadata. Therefore, we use third party APIs to generate screenshots and OpenGraph images for the tools, which are accessed through our services and handlers.

> Found in: `content/tooling`

### Citation Processing
We have done one isolated run of a Citation Processor, and it works but the resulting format may not be optimal. We need to evaluate the output and make product decisions before we can integrate it into the core FileSystemObserver.

## Running the Observer

To run the observer and process both citations and frontmatter:

```bash
cd /Users/mpstaton/code/lossless-monorepo/tidyverse
pnpm start
```

This will run the `start` script defined in package.json, which executes `ts-node observers/index.ts`.

You can also specify a custom content root directory as an argument:

```bash
pnpm start -- ../../content
```

This will:
1. Start the FileSystemObserver
2. Watch for file changes in configured directories
3. Process citations in markdown files (convert numeric to hex)
4. Validate and update frontmatter
5. Generate reports periodically

## How Watchers Work:

The observer system relies on a set of independent "watchers" to monitor specific content collections for new files or modifications. This modular approach ensures that each collection is processed according to its unique requirements and prevents issues in one collection from affecting others. Here's a breakdown of their operation:

1.  **Configuration and Initialization**:
    *   Watcher configurations are primarily managed in `tidyverse/observers/userOptionsConfig.ts`. This file defines which directories (collections) are actively monitored by the system.
    *   The master orchestration script, `tidyverse/observers/index.ts`, initiates the `FileSystemObserver` (detailed in `tidyverse/observers/fileSystemObserver.ts`).
    *   The `FileSystemObserver` iterates through the `directoryConfigs` from `userOptionsConfig.ts`. For each configured directory, it sets up a dedicated file system watcher instance (typically using a library like `chokidar`).
    *   Each watcher is responsible for a specific content collection path (e.g., `content/lost-in-public/prompts`, `content/tooling`).

2.  **Event Detection**:
    *   Watchers are set to listen for file system events, primarily:
        *   `add`: When a new file is created in a watched directory.
        *   `change`: When an existing file is modified in a watched directory.
    *   The `FileSystemObserver` includes a "propertyCollector" mechanism. This component is crucial for:
        *   Receiving an "expectation" object, which lists properties that will be created or modified by downstream processes (handlers, services).
        *   Managing a cooldown period.
        *   Maintaining an in-memory log of processed files to prevent infinite loops and redundant operations.

3.  **Processing Workflow (per file event)**:
    *   When a file event (add/change) occurs, the `FileSystemObserver`'s `onChange` (or similar) method is triggered, receiving the `dirConfig` for the specific file.
    *   The system first consults the propertyCollector to ensure the file is eligible for processing.
    *   The task is then delegated to the appropriate processing pipeline, which involves a series of steps tailored to the collection:

    a.  **Citation Processing** (Conditional):
        *   If applicable to the collection and enabled, citations within the markdown file are processed (e.g., converting numeric citations to hex format) using methods like `processCitationsInFile`.

    b.  **Frontmatter Processing**: This is a core function involving multiple sub-steps:
        *   **Extraction**: The existing YAML frontmatter is read from the file using utilities like `tidyverse/observers/utils/yamlFrontmatter.ts`.
        *   **Validation & Templating**: The extracted frontmatter is validated against a predefined template specific to the collection (e.g., `tidyverse/observers/templates/issue-resolution.ts` for the issue resolution collection). This step ensures consistency and completeness.
        *   **Applying Handlers**: A set of handlers from `tidyverse/observers/handlers/` are invoked to modify or add frontmatter properties. Common handlers include:
            *   `addSiteUUID.ts`: Ensures every content piece has a unique `site_uuid`.
            *   Specialized handlers like `processOpenGraphMetadata.ts` or `processScreenshotMetadata.ts` may be used for specific collections (like 'tooling') that require integration with services (`tidyverse/observers/services/`).
        *   **Normalization & Enrichment**: Property names are normalized, and missing required fields (as defined by the template) are added.
        *   **Updating**: The modified frontmatter is written back to the file using `tidyverse/observers/utils/yamlFrontmatter.ts`.

4.  **Logging and Reporting**:
    *   Throughout the process, detailed logs are output to the console, indicating files being processed, specific actions taken (e.g., citations converted, frontmatter updated), and any errors or warnings encountered.
    *   The system may also generate periodic reports summarizing its activity.

## How Citation Processing Works

As detailed in the "Processing Workflow" of the "How Watchers Work" section, citation processing is a conditional step triggered by a watcher when a new or modified markdown file is detected in a relevant collection.

If enabled for the collection, the `processCitationsInFile` method (or a similar utility) is invoked. This method typically performs the following actions:

1.  **Converts Numeric Citations**: Identifies numeric citations within the content and converts them to a standardized format (e.g., hexadecimal).
2.  **Updates Citation Registry**: Maintains a registry or database of all citations encountered, ensuring consistency and enabling features like a master bibliography.
3.  **Generates Footnotes**: If the citation style requires it, this step automatically creates or updates a footnotes section at the end of the document.

It's important to note, as mentioned earlier, that while an isolated citation processor has been tested, its output format is pending further evaluation to ensure it meets product standards before wider integration into all relevant observer workflows.

## Monitoring Results

The observer will output logs to the console showing:
- Files being processed
- Citations being converted
- Frontmatter being updated
- Any errors or warnings

Reports are generated in the `content/reports` directory every 5 minutes and when the observer is shut down.
