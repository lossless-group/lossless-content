# Write an note that leaves a breadcrumb for future Issue Resolution

## Context:
Let's assume our future selves, another AI coding assistant, or you five minutes from now has no memory of the issue we had.... but is bound to run into it!  And bound to get stuck again!  

## Pattern:

1. What were we trying to do and why 
2. List incorrect attempts with the necessary code for someone to be able to comprehend the related codebase.  
2. Explain the "Aha!" moment, the eureka. How did we solve it?  
4. Put forth the final solution with the necessary code for someone to be able to comprehend the related codebase.
