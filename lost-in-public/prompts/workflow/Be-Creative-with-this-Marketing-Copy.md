# Context

We have a technology startup we are calling Coglet. We think Agentic AI and agent-to-agent cooperation, human-in-the-loop will be a big breakthrough for every businesses. 

## Copy Ideas

Give your team an army of helpers, working in a way that fits the way you work.  

You shouldn't need to spend so much time adapting to AI, AI should be adapting to you. 

What if AI adapted to your company, instead of the other way around. 

Agentic Workspaces and Workflow Automation Tools have a UI that most people don't want to learn.  Let's just let people talk to them like a teammate.  

AI Companions + Agentic Employees = Coglets.
