image_prompt: An AI assistant and nerd developer are garbage men with orange vests getting off the back of a garbage truck.  The camera lens can see the brand of the garbage truck, it says `Refactor & Recycle.` The robot is climbing into a large, commercial garbage bin.

# Objective:
Port React code generated by Figma into elegant Astro code, with minimum inclusion of libraries and dependencies.  Port sections one by one until we have a working landing page.

## Steps:

1. Port React code generated by Figma into elegant Astro code, with minimum inclusion of libraries and dependencies.  Port sections one by one until we have a working landing page.

Here's a formal legal page the React code we want to port, it's the privacy policy page please write a new one at `/Users/mpstaton/code/lossless-monorepo/astro-knots/sites/cilantro-site/src/pages/formalities/PrivacyPolicy.astro`

Note that we do not want to use any of these libraries, we need to implement motion with CSS:

```jsx
import { motion } from 'motion/react';

export function PrivacyPolicy() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-white">
      <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-6 py-24">
        <motion.div
          initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
          animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
          transition={{ duration: 0.6 }}
          className="space-y-12"
        >
          {/* Header */}
          <div className="text-center space-y-4">
            <h1 className="text-[#091B35]">Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p className="text-gray-600 max-w-2xl mx-auto">

2. Review our exploration on [[/lost-in-public/explorations/Multi-Site-Astro-Starter-Kit-Architecture.md|Multi-Site Astro Starter Kit Architecture]] and review our package architecture.  Make sure we refactor this new Astro code into perfectly setup Astro Knots with our configuration-first philosophy.
