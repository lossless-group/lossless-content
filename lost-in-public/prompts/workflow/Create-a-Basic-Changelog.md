# Purpose  # High-level goal
Establish consistent, informative changelog entries that document changes to code and content across the project.

## Directory Structure  # File organization
1. Code Changes:  # Technical modifications
   ```
   site/src/content/changelog--code/  # Root directory for code changes
   ├── YYYY-MM-DD_index.md  # Daily entries
   └── reports/  # Detailed technical reports
       └── YYYY-MM-DD_description_index.md
   ```

2. Content Changes:  # Documentation/content updates
   ```
   site/src/content/changelog--content/  # Root directory for content changes
   ├── YYYY-MM-DD_index.md  # Daily entries
   └── reports/  # Detailed content reports
       └── YYYY-MM-DD_description_index.md
   ```
