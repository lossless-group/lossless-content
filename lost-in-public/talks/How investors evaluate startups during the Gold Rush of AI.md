# Provocations (or Contrarian Points of View)


### 1. Let the bots have the jobs

We will be glad to offload the work AI will replace. 

### 2. Easier to learn up learning curves.

AI will make it easier to learn new "Knowledge Economy" skills, as well as perform them. 


### 3. The challenge isn't using AI, it's all the other stuff.

Organizations seeking to adopt AI will quickly find that it's not about adopting AI.  It's about having good data, enabling and empowering teams, supporting innovators who cause problems with others, aligning on brand and mission, etc. There will be an increased role for [[concepts/Stack Engineering|Stack Engineering]], and positions will be created to hire [[concepts/Stack Engineering|Stack Engineers]] instead of junior developers, though the persons filling them will be roughly the same.

### 4. Long term value capture will go to the Vertical Wrappers

Model "creators" or "producers" or "vendors" are in the greatest dogfight in generations. The value will go to the "Vertical Wrappers" that nail a particular customer base because they power a specific use case. (Examples: [[Tooling/AI-Toolkit/AI Interfaces/AI Workspaces/Vertical Wrappers/Jasper|Jasper]], [[Tooling/AI-Toolkit/AI Interfaces/AI Workspaces/Vertical Wrappers/Granola|Granola]] )


### 5. Demand for Software Engineering will rise even faster

[[Vibe Coding]] is becoming super sophisticated, [[concepts/Explainers for AI/Context Engineering|Context Engineering]], and it will be a skill set in and of itself, just as important as software engineering has been.  

Context Engineers cannot be successful without the deep involvement of senior, philosopher Software Engineers who have very artful opinions on how to develop code, how to architect complex projects, how to manage hundreds or thousands of people contributing to codebases. Demand for real Software Engineers goes up not down in the future. 


### 6. AI is not that Intelligent.  It's pretty stupid, actually. 

Generative AI and Agentic AI is mostly hot air and bullshit right now.  It only really unseats humans in very limited use cases, and even then the only people that can "tell it what to do" are the same humans whose jobs they are theoretically replacing. 


### 6. It's the accountants that should be scared. 

White Collar jobs that pay very well are the first to have to massively reposition.  Shipyard metal workers and neighborhood plumbers are last.  Accountants are the ones who need to reposition now, not taxi drivers. 


### 7. Sitting this out is not an option. 
Everyone should be getting their hands dirty.  Even though AI is massively overhyped and its really just idiocracy, the future will go to those that have a coherent vision on what to do and why.  AI can generate good sounding strategies, but ultimately it will be humans who make the decisions, set priorities, create purpose, rally teams, etc. The only way to know how to do that for the new era is to go in and break your face on it.
