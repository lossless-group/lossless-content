image_prompt: A man and a robot (representing AI) are standing beyond the door to a tornado shelter that's underground, the door is a hatch coming out of the ground at an angle. It's an image similar to the Wizard of Oz. The storm shelter has two swinging doors, and one door is shut. Someone is holding the other door open.  All three are looking at a giant storm coming, with many tornadoes touching down.
