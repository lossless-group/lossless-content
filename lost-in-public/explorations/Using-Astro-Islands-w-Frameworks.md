# Context

We have hit the limits of static sites.  We need to add islands of reactive components to our beautiful Astro site. Astro has "actions" and "server side rendering" capabilities, but we may as well have a frontend framework on hand to use when the limits of SSG are reached. 

# Trying out Svelte

We have been evaluating and testing Svelte for a while now, and we have come to love it.  It is a great framework for building reactive components. It just doesn't feel as complicated as React.

# Trying out RevealJS

Our content could be complimented by a presentation framework.  We've played with Marp and Slides.dev. There seems to be hype around Reveal.
