# Article Text
When searching for an **email newsletter API service** that supports sending from **multiple domains you own**, focus on these specific features and considerations:

**Key Features to Look For:**

- **Multiple Domain Management:** Ensure the provider allows you to add and manage several sending domains under a single account. This is crucial for keeping your brands or projects separate and maintaining deliverability for each domain [^975b21] .[^6f2c91][^52c00d]
    
- **API Access for Domain Operations:** Look for services that let you programmatically add, verify, and manage domains via their API, which saves time and enables automation .[^975b21][^52c00d]
    
- **Low-Volume Friendly Plans:** Since your email volume is low, prioritize providers that do not penalize you for low usage, or that offer affordable plans for small senders[^72fb17].[^8b777c]
    
- **Per-Domain Analytics and Settings:** The ability to track analytics, manage templates, and handle suppression lists separately for each domain is important for clarity and compliance. [^975b21] 

- **Segregated Reputation:** Each domain should have its own sending reputation, so issues with one domain do not affect others. [^975b21] [^6f2c91]

- **Subdomain Usage:** For best deliverability, consider using subdomains (e.g., mail.yourdomain.com, newsletter.yourdomain.com) for different purposes[^ed8279][^38d0c3].

- **DNS Setup:** You will need to add SPF, DKIM, and possibly DMARC records for each domain to ensure deliverability and compliance[^ed8279][^38d0c3][^a54a1b].
- 
**Popular Providers Supporting Multiple Domains:**

| Provider   | Multiple Domains | API Management | Notes                                              |     |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --- |

- **Custom Sending Domains:** Make sure you can send from your own domains, not just the provider’s default domain. This typically requires adding DNS records for each domain you wish to send from [^ed8279] [^37347c] [^fc723d] [^38d0c3]

- **Account Structure:** Some platforms offer agency or multi-brand dashboards, which help keep data and access segregated[^975b21] [^8b777c]
    

**Summary of Approach:**

1. **Shortlist providers** with explicit support for multiple custom domains and robust API access.
    
2. **Review their documentation** for domain management endpoints and per-domain analytics.
    
3. **Check pricing tiers** to ensure low-volume sending is cost-effective.
    
4. **Confirm DNS setup requirements** and ease of onboarding new domains.
    

By focusing on these criteria, you’ll find a service that matches your requirements for **multi-domain, low-volume newsletter management via API**.
