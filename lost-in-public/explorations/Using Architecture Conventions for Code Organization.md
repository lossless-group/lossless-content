A clearer breakdown of the differences between `lib` and `utils` directories in a TypeScript/JavaScript project:

### utils

```
utils/
```

 Directory

- **Purpose**: Contains small, reusable utility functions
- **Characteristics**:
    - Stateless functions
    - No side effects
    - Pure functions where possible
    - Single responsibility
    - Framework-agnostic
- **Examples**:
    - String manipulation
    - Date formatting
    - Validation helpers
    - Simple calculations

### lib

```
lib/
```

 Directory

- **Purpose**: Contains more complex business logic and application services
- **Characteristics**:
    - May maintain state
    - Can have side effects
    - May depend on external services
    - Often contains classes or modules
    - May be framework-specific
- **Examples**:
    - API clients
    - Data transformation services
    - Complex business logic
    - Integration with external services
