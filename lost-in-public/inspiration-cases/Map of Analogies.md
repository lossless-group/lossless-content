## `tidyverse` Submodule

-   **Analogy:** The `tidyverse` submodule acts like the **quality control and data preparation department** for the entire project. It houses the tools and processes (scripts) needed to ensure all the raw materials (content, data) are clean, consistent, and meet the required standards before being used elsewhere in the 'factory' (the monorepo).
