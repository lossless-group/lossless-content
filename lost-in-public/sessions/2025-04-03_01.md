# Goal
Build a custom markdown rendering pipeline that processes AST transformations step-by-step, ensuring proper handling of callouts and other elements without relying on external libraries.

## Current Memories in Context

1. AST Transformation Pipeline Understanding <----New Memory!
   - MDAST represents markdown concepts (blockquote, paragraph, etc.)
   - HAST represents HTML concepts (elements, attributes)
   - One-way process: Markdown → MDAST → HAST → HTML
   - Data flows through node.data properties

2. Fixed Critical Issues in AST Pipeline
   - remark-callout-handler no longer flattens content
   - rehype-callout-handler removed problematic details/summary
   - Better paragraph preservation
   - Explicit tree returns

3. Remark Plugins Implementation
   - remarkBacklinks for wiki-style links
   - remarkImages for image processing
   - Proper path routing and alt text handling

### Dialog

#### USER:
Can you please explain the MDAST and the HAST phase in @[content/lost-in-public/issue-resolution/Rendering-AST.md] before we proceed with implementation? We have spent two days in circles and need to be more careful.

#### ASSISTANT:
I'll add a clear explanation of the MDAST and HAST phases to the issue resolution document...

[Added comprehensive explanation of AST phases to Rendering-AST.md]

[Created memory about AST transformation pipeline understanding]

Would you like me to start implementing the first phase (MDAST transformation) now that we have a clear understanding of how the pipeline works?

#### USER:
I want you to start a new session for today, use the @[content/lost-in-public/rag-input/Maintain-a-Session-Log.md]

Every few minutes I will ask you to ADD our dialog you have access to into it. I'm tired of running around in circles.

#### ASSISTANT:
[Checked session log guidelines and created this new session log]

The session log has been created at `/content/lost-in-public/sessions/2025-04-03_01.md` following the required format. I've included our initial dialog and the current memories in context. Would you like me to continue with implementing the MDAST transformation phase now?

#### USER:
Let's create a new prompt for rendering markdown callouts using insights gathered from previous unsuccessful attempts and the learnings documented in the Issue Resolution document.

#### ASSISTANT:
Let me create a new prompt that synthesizes our learnings and provides clear guidance for AST transformations:

[Created new prompt at `/content/lost-in-public/prompts/render-logic/Render-Markdown-Deliberately-from-Inspiration.md`]

I've created a comprehensive prompt that:
1. Synthesizes our learnings from astro-big-doc and our issue resolution
2. Provides a clear four-phase pipeline approach
3. Emphasizes error handling and debugging
4. Includes practical code examples for each phase
5. Outlines a clear directory structure and testing strategy

Would you like me to explain any part of the prompt in more detail?

#### USER:
[Snippet identifier=Render-Markdown-Deliberately-from-Inspiration.md#L112-129]
## Directory Structure

```
site/src/
├── utils/
│   └── markdown/
│       ├── phases/           # Pipeline phases
│       │   ├── detect.ts
│       │   ├── isolate.ts
│       │   ├── transform.ts
│       │   └── embed.ts
│       ├── config/          # Configuration
│       │   └── callouts.ts
│       ├── debug/          # Debug utilities
│       │   └── ast-debug.ts
│       └── types/          # TypeScript definitions
│           └── ast.d.ts
```
[/Snippet] I don't like this directory structure.  Each "type" of extended or flavored markdown has it's own directory:

`site/src/utils/markdown`

Within each "type" of markdown we should have the pipeline files for detect, isolate, transform, embed.  

Once we have working code and its manageable maybe we will merge them into one file.  

#### ASSISTANT:
I'll update the directory structure to better organize by markdown type:

[Updated directory structure in the prompt to organize by feature type]

I've updated the structure to:
1. Organize by markdown feature type (callouts, wiki-links, tables)
2. Each feature has its own complete pipeline implementation
3. Keep shared code (config, types, utils) at the root level
4. Updated all code examples to reflect the new paths

This makes it much easier to:
1. Add new markdown features (just add a new directory)
2. Keep related code together
3. Understand what code handles what feature
4. Merge into single files later if needed

Would you like me to make any other adjustments to the structure?

#### USER:
Okay we made progress on debugging using Astro features.  

Please reference @[site/src/utils/debug/ast-debugger.ts] @[AstDebugger] 

Please reference the debug output directory structure, `site/debug`

We still want the user to be able to pass a variable from the path that will "print" or generate json files with the AST output at every step of the transformation.

Related, I believe our previous dead ends had two themes 1) we were detecting the pattern and transforming the string values, but we were not then "adding" or "updating" the new value to the right place in the AST.  or 2) sequencing. 

Within sequencing, 1) we were detecting and updating correctly, but it was being overrriden by a later process in the sequence.  or 2) the extended unique flavor syntax was being "Cleaned" by a process previous to our transformation pipeline.  

Please add these common pitfalls to @[content/lost-in-public/prompts/render-logic/Render-Markdown-Deliberately-from-Inspiration.md] 

#### ASSISTANT:
[Added comprehensive sections about common AST transformation pitfalls and debug-driven development to the prompt]

I've added sections about:

1. **AST Transformation Pitfalls** with examples of:
   - Node placement issues (transforming values vs structure)
   - Sequencing problems (order of plugins)
   - Early cleanup issues (syntax removal)

2. **Debug-Driven Development** including:
   - AST debug output implementation
   - Debug directory structure
   - How to enable debug output via URL parameters
   - Key debug points to check

3. **Prevention Checklist** for:
   - Before implementation
   - During development
   - After changes

Each section includes practical code examples and clear wrong/right patterns. Would you like me to expand on any of these areas or add more specific examples?

#### USER:
Now ADD as much of our dialog, per @[content/lost-in-public/rag-input/Maintain-a-Session-Log.md]  prompt, to today's session log.  do not destroy or summarize

#### ASSISTANT:
I'll check the git branches in the site directory:

```bash
$ git branch -a
  development
  feature/code-changelog
  feature/litegal
  feature/markdown-render
* feature/render-big-astro
  feature/starwind-integration
  master
  remotes/origin/2025-03-21_restore
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/development
  remotes/origin/feature/code-changelog
  remotes/origin/feature/litegal
  remotes/origin/feature/markdown-render
  remotes/origin/feature/starwind-integration
  remotes/origin/main
  remotes/origin/master
```

We're currently on the `feature/render-big-astro` branch, which aligns with our work on the AST transformation pipeline inspired by astro-big-doc.

#### USER:
Now we do commit

#### ASSISTANT:
```bash
$ git commit -m "prebuild(AST): save state of code prior to implementing new render pipeline

Current state includes:
- Modified remark-callout-handler.ts with basic detection
- Added new rehype-callout-handler.ts for HTML transformation
- Created debug utilities and AST type definitions
- Added markdown component directory structure

Modified files:
site/src/utils/markdown/
   remark-callout-handler.ts
   rehype-callout-handler.ts (new)

site/src/components/markdown/ (new)
   - Component structure for rendering

site/src/utils/debug/ (new)
   - AST debugging utilities
   - Debug output configuration

site/src/types/ (new)
   hast-util-to-html.d.ts
   hast.ts
   mdast-extended.d.ts
   remark-callout-handler.d.ts

Changes preserve current functionality while setting up
structure for new AST transformation pipeline"
