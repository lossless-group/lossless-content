# Session Log: Enhanced OpenGraph Data Fetching

## Context
Working on improving the OpenGraph data fetching script to be more robust, handle errors better, and provide clearer reporting.


## Key Achievements

1. Enhanced Code Documentation
   - Added comprehensive function documentation
   - Clarified implementation details and error handling
   - Improved cross-referencing between functions

2. Improved Error Handling
   - Fixed screenshot fetch error handling
   - Added proper error propagation
   - Enhanced error reporting in output files

3. Report Generation
   - Updated template to include screenshot counts
   - Fixed formatting for file paths
   - Added clear categorization of successes and failures

4. Testing and Validation
   - Successfully tested on multiple directories
   - Verified parallel processing functionality
   - Confirmed proper error handling and reporting

## Files Modified

1. `/site/scripts/build-scripts/runFetchOpenGraphData.cjs`
   - Enhanced function documentation
   - Fixed error handling
   - Updated report generation

2. `/content/lost-in-public/prompts/workflow/Fetch-Open-Graph-Data-from-API.md`
   - Complete rewrite with thorough implementation guide
   - Added detailed specifications
   - Included code examples and best practices

## Final State
The script is now production-ready with:
- Robust error handling
- Clear documentation
- Efficient parallel processing
- Comprehensive reporting
- Proper file safety measures


## Dialog

USER: Let's work on the OpenGraph data fetching script. I want to improve the error handling and make sure it generates good reports.

A: I'll help you enhance the script. First, let me look at the current implementation.
[Reviewed current script]

USER: Yes, we need to make it more robust. The script should handle API errors gracefully and maintain good file safety.

A: I'll start by improving the error handling in the fetch functions. Here's what I propose:
1. Add retry logic for API calls
2. Better error categorization
3. Safe file updates
[Implemented error handling improvements]

USER: Good. Now let's make sure the reports are clear and helpful.

A: I'll enhance the report generation:
1. Added proper frontmatter template
2. Improved statistics tracking
3. Clear file categorization
[Updated report generation]

USER: The script is crashing when there's a YAML error. Can we fix that?

A: Yes, let's switch to plain text parsing instead of using gray-matter:
1. Added custom frontmatter parser
2. Preserved line positioning
3. Added validation checks
[Implemented safer YAML handling]

USER: Perfect. Now let's test it with a small set of files.

A: Running the test:
[Test output with successful processing]
I see a few more things we can improve:
1. Better parallel processing
2. Screenshot fetch tracking
3. Memory management
[Made performance improvements]

USER: Step Id: 248
[Checkpoint summary of previous work on enhancing OpenGraph data fetching]

ASSISTANT: Let me also enhance the comments for the fetch functions and main function:
[Made comprehensive comment improvements to runFetchOpenGraphData.cjs]

USER: Step Id: 253
[Changed TARGET_DIR in runFetchOpenGraphData.cjs from '../content/tooling/AI-Toolkit/Data Augmenters' to '../content/tooling/AI-Toolkit']

USER: Step Id: 254
[Viewed file contents]

USER: Step Id: 255
Okay, let's run one last test run, then we document our progress before we run it on all the files.

ASSISTANT: [Ran test with updated TARGET_DIR]

USER: Step Id: 270
[Referenced snippet from report template needing update]
We need to make sure the New Open Graph data is accompanied by the New Screenshots count. We forgot that one in the output template.

ASSISTANT: [Updated report template to include screenshot count]

USER: Step Id: 281
Perfect! Now I want you to use the log and comments in runFetchOpenGraphData.cjs, as well as utils addReportFrontmatterTemplate.cjs and addReportNamingConventions.cjs, and rewrite the Fetch-Open-Graph-Data-from-API.md prompt and have it be VERY THOROUGH!

ASSISTANT: [Created comprehensive implementation guide with detailed specifications]

USER: Step Id: 293
[No specific request, continuing work]

ASSISTANT: [Ran final test to verify all changes]

USER: Step Id: 299

USER: Step Id: 300
[Requested session log creation]
