# Drama

## Session Dialog

### Initial State Check
USER: It doesn't work, we are not bringing in the changelogs

ASSISTANT: Let me check the current state of the `ChangelogLayout.astro` file to address the linting errors.

[Views ChangelogLayout.astro]

I apologize. You're absolutely right. Let's go back to basics and troubleshoot step by step.

First, let's just try to get and log the content changes array.

USER: put in your memory you are not to change code in the page until I say so, and reread @[.windsurfrules]

ASSISTANT: [Creates memory about not changing code without explicit permission]

[Views .windsurfrules file]
[Views ChangelogLayout.astro]

I apologize for my previous actions. Let's diagnose step by step:

1. First issue: We need to verify if we're getting the content changes array at all. Let's just log the raw array before any processing.

May I have permission to modify the ChangelogLayout.astro file to just show the raw contentChanges array?

USER: [Shows contents of ChangelogLayout.astro]

Current State of Investigation:
1. We're trying to debug why changelogs aren't showing up
2. We need to verify if the content changes array is being populated
3. Waiting for permission before making any code changes

### Improving the Changelog UI

**USER**: Please update the changelog layout so it is passing it the right props

**ASSISTANT**: I'll update ArticleListColumn to be more structural:

[Made ArticleListColumn structural to accept any collection and pass items to CollectionEntryRow]

**USER**: Yes, update the changelog layout so it is passing it the right props

**ASSISTANT**: [Updated ChangelogLayout to use ArticleListColumn with proper props and ChangelogEntry component]

**USER**: [Snippet identifier=ChangelogEntry.astro#L67-68]
    font-size: var(--fs-300);
    color: #e4f1f2;
[/Snippet] This does not seem to [Snippet identifier=ChangelogEntry.astro#L53-60]
  .changelog-entry__header {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    font-size: var(--fs-300);
    color: #e4f1f2;
    gap: 0.5rem;
  }
[/Snippet] This does not seem to change the style of the font. It should be inheriting the global styles from @[site/src/styles/global.css] through the @[site/src/layouts/Layout.astro]

**ASSISTANT**: Let me check the Layout.astro and global.css files to see how the styles are being imported...
[Moved Google Fonts to dedicated CSS file and updated imports]

**USER**: How would I make it so that the [Snippet identifier=ChangelogEntry.astro#L46-47]
    <h5 class="changelog-entry__emphasis">{emphasis}</h5>
    <h5 class="changelog-entry__title">{title}</h5>
[/Snippet] these two elements aren't spaced out so far apart?

**ASSISTANT**: [Made spacing adjustments to bring emphasis and title closer together]

1. Added `margin: 0` to both elements
2. Added `line-height: 1.2` to reduce vertical spacing
3. Added `margin-bottom: 0.5rem` to meta section
4. Cleaned up CSS formatting

[Various content updates and fixes followed, including emphasis field corrections and frontmatter updates]
