# Goal:
Resolve TypeScript errors in callout debugging and maintain proper session logging practices.

## Session Dialog

### USER:
Explain what this problem is and help me fix it: Property 'calloutDebug' does not exist on type 'Window & typeof globalThis'. @[/Users/mpstaton/code/lossless-monorepo/site/src/components/markdown/callouts/ArticleCallout.astro:L39]

### ASSISTANT:
Let me look at the code in ArticleCallout.astro to understand the context of this TypeScript error.

[*Assistant viewed the file outline and contents*]

I see the issue. This is a TypeScript error related to extending the global Window interface. The code is trying to add a custom property `calloutDebug` to the window object for debugging purposes, but TypeScript doesn't know about this property.

The code already has an interface declaration for Window, but it needs to be declared using the global augmentation syntax to properly extend the Window interface. Let me fix this by modifying the script section:

[*Assistant made the following changes to ArticleCallout.astro*]
```diff
@@ -21,8 +21,10 @@
     content: string | undefined;
   }

+  declare global {
+    interface Window {
+      calloutDebug: CalloutDebugData[];
+    }
-  interface Window {
-    calloutDebug: CalloutDebugData[];
   }

   // Make callout data available in browser console
```

I've fixed the TypeScript error by properly declaring the global Window interface augmentation. Here's what was wrong and how I fixed it:

1. The original code tried to extend the Window interface directly, which doesn't work for global interfaces in TypeScript
2. The correct way is to use the `declare global` syntax to augment global interfaces
3. I wrapped the Window interface declaration in a `declare global` block, which tells TypeScript to merge this interface with the global Window type

This change maintains the same functionality but properly types the `window.calloutDebug` property so TypeScript knows it exists. The error should now be resolved.

This follows best practices for TypeScript global augmentation and aligns with the debug-driven development principle mentioned in the memories, particularly for maintaining proper type safety while adding debug utilities.

### Debugging AST Callout Rendering

**USER**: @[dom-element:article] you are not doing it correctly.  

Let's be careful, can you use the console to see the AST as it comes in? It's too long for me to see it in the console in the browser and in the command line.

**ASSISTANT**: *Adds debug logging to ArticleCallout.astro to see the AST structure*

```astro
// Debug: Log just the essential parts
console.log('=== ArticleCallout Debug ===');
console.log('Node type:', node?.type);
console.log('Children:', node?.children?.map(child => ({type: child.type})));
```

**USER**: Hold on, @[site/src/components/markdown/callouts/ArticleCallout.astro] you are only saying if node === blockquote, but by the time it is passed in it shouldn't be flagged as a blockquote, it should just be the contents.  

You should take the first line of the first node of what comes in, I don't even think it's a child at this point.  

**ASSISTANT**: *Modifies ArticleCallout to handle content directly without checking for blockquote type*

**USER**: IT IS NOW WORKING, BUT NOW YOU ARE ONLY RENDERING THE FIRST PARAGRAPH!

**ASSISTANT**: *Realizes we need to pass the entire blockquote node in AstroMarkdown.astro instead of just node.children[0]*

*Fixes AstroMarkdown.astro to pass full blockquote:*
```astro
{(node.type === "blockquote") &&
    <ArticleCallout node={node} />
}
```

*Debug output shows the full structure:*
```
=== ArticleCallout Debug ===
Node type: blockquote
Children: [
  { type: 'paragraph' }, { type: 'paragraph' },
  { type: 'heading' },   { type: 'paragraph' },
  { type: 'list' },      { type: 'paragraph' },
  ...
]
Extracted: {
  calloutType: 'LLM Response',
  calloutTitle: 'Perplexity explains agile.'
}
```

**USER**: That's what I am saying, it's THE FIRST LINE

**ASSISTANT**: *Updates ArticleCallout to properly handle the first line of text while preserving all content:*

1. Gets the first paragraph's first text node
2. Splits by newline and extracts metadata from first line
3. Preserves the rest of the content structure
4. Successfully extracts type "LLM Response" and title "Perplexity explains agile"
5. Maintains all paragraphs, headings, and lists in the content

Final working structure:
```astro
// Get the first paragraph's first text node
const firstParagraph = node?.children?.[0];
if (firstParagraph?.type === 'paragraph') {
  const firstTextNode = firstParagraph.children?.[0];
  if (firstTextNode?.type === 'text') {
    const lines = firstTextNode.value.split('\n');
    const firstLine = lines[0];
    // Extract metadata and preserve content...
  }
}
```

The callout now correctly renders with:
- Proper metadata extraction from first line
- Complete content preservation
- All formatting intact

# Current Memories in Context

1. Fixed critical issues in AST transformation pipeline for callouts
   - No longer flattens content with toString()
   - Only checks first line for callout syntax
   - Properly preserves node structure
   - Explicit tree return

2. Key principles for AST transformations
   - Four-Phase Pipeline (Detect, Isolate, Transform, Embed)
   - Error Handling First
   - Debug-Driven Development
   - Structured directory organization
   - Comprehensive testing strategy

3. AST transformation pipeline details
   - MDAST (Markdown AST) concepts
   - HAST (HTML AST) concepts
   - One-way process flow
   - Data flow patterns

4. Astro and Remark documentation requirements
   - Always reference official docs
   - Special care for module imports
   - No assumptions about behavior
   - Verify implementation details

5. Vocabulary collection setup
   - No required frontmatter
   - Title/slug from filename
   - Uses glob loader
   - Component hierarchy

6. Documentation historical record rules
   - Never modify historical records
   - Append-only for issue resolution and sessions
   - Preserve chronological order
   - Maintain complete context

7. Remark plugins implementation
   - remarkBacklinks for wiki-style links
   - remarkImages for image processing
   - Plugin order matters
   - Modified regex patterns

8. TypeScript rehype plugin resolution
   - Using curried functions
   - Proper typing with Plugin<[], Root, Root>
   - Typed wrapper for rehypeAstro
   - Understanding unified plugins

9. Server management practices
   - Check for running processes
   - Verify server status
   - Standard ports (4321, 4173)

10. Code ownership and responsibility
    - Taking full responsibility for code
    - Direct communication about issues
    - First person for code changes

11. Permission rules
    - No permission needed for creative actions
    - Permission required for destructive actions
    - System-level changes need approval

12. Server port management
    - Primary port: 4321
    - Fallback ports: 4322, 4323
    - Track active ports
    - Clean up when done

13. Configuration file modification rules
    - Check git history first
    - View previous working states
    - Careful comparison
    - Preserve working configurations

14. Documentation organization
    - Core Framework (Astro)
    - Markdown Processing
    - UI and Styling
    - Development Tools
    - Package Management
    - Version Control

15. Server management workflow
    - Kill existing servers first
    - Prevent port conflicts
    - Clean state maintenance

16. Monorepo branch strategy
    - master: Production-ready
    - development: Active work
    - Submodule tracking rules

17. Visuals collection configuration
    - Uses glob loader
    - Supports multiple formats
    - Schema with metadata
