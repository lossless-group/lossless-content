## Prompt Enhancement (Steps 43-51)

**Cascade:** Okay, I've reviewed the guidelines in `Improve-on-a-User-Prompt-through-Iteration.md`. Now, let's look at the prompt you've started in `Refactor-Reference-Lists-into-Reference-Grid.md` to see how we can enhance it. [Viewed prompt file]

**Cascade:** Okay, the current prompt provides a good starting point:
*   **Goal:** Refactor the grid from `site/src/pages/more-about/index.astro` into `site/src/components/reference/ReferenceGrid.astro`.
*   **Constraint:** Use the project's CSS framework (`@/styles`) instead of Tailwind.

Based on the `Improve-on-a-User-Prompt-through-Iteration.md` guidelines, we can make this prompt much more effective by adding details about:
1.  **Data Flow & Props**
2.  **Styling Requirements**
3.  **Target Structure & Examples**
4.  **(Optional) Diagram**

Would you like me to draft these additional sections for the `Refactor-Reference-Lists-into-Reference-Grid.md` prompt file?

**USER:** I actually love the mermaid diagrams so please include that. But yeas, that's what I want! Please improve the prompt directly in the file

**Cascade:** Okay, I will enhance the prompt file `Refactor-Reference-Lists-into-Reference-Grid.md` following the guidelines and including the sections we discussed. First, I need to see the current implementation in `site/src/pages/more-about/index.astro` to accurately describe the starting point, data fetching, and rendering logic. I'll also check the current state of `site/src/components/reference/ReferenceGrid.astro`. [Viewed `index.astro`, Viewed `ReferenceGrid.astro`]

**Cascade:** Okay, I have the context from `site/src/pages/more-about/index.astro` and see that `site/src/components/reference/ReferenceGrid.astro` is currently empty. I will now enhance the prompt in `Refactor-Reference-Lists-into-Reference-Grid.md` with the details we discussed, including the Mermaid diagram. [Edited `Refactor-Reference-Lists-into-Reference-Grid.md`]

**Cascade:** Okay, I've updated the prompt file `Refactor-Reference-Lists-into-Reference-Grid.md` with the detailed sections we discussed, including the Mermaid diagram. This should provide a much clearer set of instructions for the refactoring task. Now, as requested, I'll update the session log `2025-04-13_Session_01.md` with our recent conversation.
