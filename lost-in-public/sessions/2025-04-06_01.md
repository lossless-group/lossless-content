# Session Dialog

### ASSISTANT:
I see several issues with how we're handling citations. The main problems are:

1. We're trying to handle citations in two places:
   - In `remarkCitations.ts` as a remark plugin
   - In `AstroMarkdown.astro` as a component transformation

2. The citation node structure isn't being properly preserved through the MDAST transformation

Let me fix this by consolidating the citation handling:

[Made changes to remarkCitations.ts]
1. Removed the pre-processing approach
2. Now directly processes citations in the remark plugin
3. Uses proper MDAST node structure with `hName` and `hProperties`
4. Handles citation extraction and container creation in one pass

[Made changes to AstroMarkdown.astro]
1. Removed duplicate citation handling logic
2. Simplified the component to just render citation nodes
3. Maintains proper node hierarchy

[Made changes to OneArticle.astro]
1. Removed citation pre-processing
2. Uses remarkCitations directly in the plugin chain
3. Added null safety for content

The key improvements are:
1. Citations are now handled entirely in the MDAST phase
2. Node structure is preserved through the transformation pipeline
3. Proper HTML element properties are set via `hName` and `hProperties`

Let me restart the dev server to apply these changes...

### USER:
It worked. We are "off to the races" with citations. We need to document our progress. So, first, I want you to grab as much dialog between us as you have access to and add it VERBATIM per the prompt @[content/lost-in-public/rag-input/Maintain-a-Session-Log.md]

### ASSISTANT:
Let me check the session log requirements first...

[Viewed session log requirements]

Now let me create a new session log for today...

[Found that file already exists]

Let me view its contents first...
