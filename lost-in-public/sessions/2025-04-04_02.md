# Context

During a refactoring session of the `site/src/utils` directory, an attempt was made to move the AST debugger utility, which resulted in site failure. This session documents the attempt and lessons learned.

## Initial Refactoring Suggestion

The initial suggestion included moving `ast-debugger.ts` from its location in `utils/debug/`, considering it as just a development tool. This was a critical error in judgment.

## Discovery of Dependencies

Upon site failure, investigation revealed the AST debugger was deeply integrated into the codebase:

1. **Markdown Components**
   - `DebugMarkdown.astro`

2. **Callout Processing Pipeline**
   - `processCalloutPipeline.ts`
   - `isolateCalloutContent.ts`
   - `detectMarkdownCallouts.ts`
   - `embedCalloutNodes.ts`
   - `transformCalloutStructure.ts`

3. **Remark Plugins**
   - `remark-callout.ts`
   - `remark-callout-handler.ts`

## Why This Matters

The AST debugger is not just a development utility - it's a core part of our:

1. Debug-driven development approach
2. Error handling strategy
3. AST transformation pipeline monitoring
4. Four-phase pipeline implementation (Detect, Isolate, Transform, Embed)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Dependency Analysis First**
   - Always map out all dependencies before suggesting moves
   - Consider both direct imports and architectural role

2. **Understanding Core Architecture**
   - The AST transformation pipeline is a fundamental part of our system
   - Debug utilities may be core features, not just development tools

3. **Documentation Importance**
   - Location of utilities can indicate their architectural role
   - The `debug` directory placement was intentional

4. **Refactoring Approach**
   - Start with dependency mapping
   - Verify against official documentation
   - Consider architectural patterns
   - Test implications before implementing

## Resolution

The AST debugger was restored to its original location in `utils/debug/`, acknowledging its critical role in the system's architecture and debug-driven development approach.
