# Blueprint for Embedding Reveal.js Presentations in Markdown

### Overview
This specification defines how we embed Reveal.js presentations within rendered markdown files using a consistent syntax that aligns with the existing backlink convention.

### Context:
We have markdown-based presentations working, and they are embeddable.

We have Astro-based presentations working, but they are not embeddable yet. They only work directly from the `src/pages/slides/` directory and the page that renders.

#### Render Pipeline Architecture:

**Content Organization:**
- Content Team works separately from Web Dev using Obsidian from monorepo root submodule (`/content`)
- Environment Variables allow anyone working in the code to set content repository that is being rendered at either `/site/src/content` or `/content`
- Markdown-based presentations are located in `/content/slides/`
- Astro-based presentations don't have a default location yet - considering `/site/src/content/slides` or `/site/src/pages/slides`

**Directive Processing (`/site/src/utils/markdown/remark-directives.ts`):**
- `directiveComponentMap` maps directive names to components: `"slides": "SlidesEmbed"`, `"slideshow": "SlidesEmbed"`
- `remarkDirectiveTransform` plugin processes `:::slides` directives in markdown
- Extracts slide paths from container content (markdown list items with backlinks)
- Converts directive to `<SlidesEmbed>` component with slides array and config

**Slide Layout (`/site/src/layouts/OneSlideDeck.astro`):**
- RevealJS-based presentation layout with CDN resources
- Provides PDF export functionality and navigation controls
- Configures RevealJS with 16:9 aspect ratio and responsive design
- Includes plugins: Markdown, Highlight, Notes, Zoom

**Markdown Processing (`/site/src/components/markdown/AstroMarkdown.astro`):**
- Lines 1830-1890: Handles `slides`/`slideshow` directives
- `slides`/`slideshow` variants could potentially untangle Astro and Markdown based render piplelines.
- Parses container content for list items with slide backlinks
- Extracts `path` and `title` from link nodes
- Returns `<SlidesEmbed>` component or debug info if no slides found

**Embedding Component (`/site/src/components/SlidesEmbed.astro`):**
- Creates iframe embedding slides via `/slides/embed/[...slug]` route
- Sanitizes paths and builds embed URL with config query parameters
- Supports configuration: theme, transition, controls, progress, autoSlide, loop

**Embed Route (`/site/src/pages/slides/embed/[...slug].astro`):**
- Reads markdown slides from `src/generated-content/slides/` directory
- Uses `MarkdownSlideDeck` layout for consistency
- Processes query parameters for RevealJS configuration

**Astro/HTML presentations (`site/src/pages/slides`) render independently**:
- Direct Astro components using `<OneSlideDeck>` layout with RevealJS
- Each presentation is a standalone `.astro` file (e.g., `Data-Augmentation-Workflow-2.astro`)
- Uses `<Layout>` wrapper with `<OneSlideDeck>` for RevealJS integration
- Contains HTML `<section>` elements for slides with RevealJS classes/attributes
- Accessible directly via `/slides/{filename}` routes
- **NOT currently embeddable** - 
  - embed route only handles markdown from `src/generated-content/slides/`
  - **embedding doesn't work with any route.**

**Current Embedding Limitation**:
- `/slides/embed/[...slug].astro` only reads `.md` files from `src/generated-content/slides/`
- No logic to detect or render Astro component presentations
- Astro presentations exist in `src/pages/slides/` but embed system doesn't check this location
- Need to extend embed route to handle both markdown and Astro presentation types

#### Task at Hand:

Enable Astro presentations to be embeddable in Markdown files that are rendered through our Markdown render pipeline. 

The current system works for markdown-based slides but needs extension to support Astro component slides with a clear path for our team to put the files. It could be in any of:
 - `src/pages/slides/`
 - `src/content/slides/`
 - `/content/slides/`

### Syntax

#### Basic Usage
```markdown
:::slides
- [[essays/my-presentation.md|Introduction to AI]]
- [[essays/deep-learning.md|Deep Learning Fundamentals]]
- [[essays/neural-networks.md|Neural Network Architecture]]
:::
```

#### With Configuration Options
```markdown
:::slides
theme: dark
transition: slide
controls: true
progress: true
autoSlide: 0
loop: false

- [[essays/intro.md|Introduction]]
- [[essays/chapter1.md|Chapter 1: Getting Started]]
- [[essays/chapter2.md|Chapter 2: Advanced Topics]]
:::
```

#### Compact Configuration
```markdown
:::slides theme=dark transition=slide
- [[essays/intro.md|Introduction]]
- [[essays/chapter1.md|Chapter 2]]
:::
```

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Parser Location
Add parsing logic in `/src/components/markdown/AstroMarkdown.astro` around line 982 in the code block switch statement.

#### 2. Parsing Logic
- Extract backlink references using regex pattern: `\[\[(.*?)\|(.*?)\]\]`
- Parse YAML-style configuration options at the beginning
- Support both `key: value` and `key=value` syntax for configuration
- Maintain slide order as specified in the markdown

#### 3. Component Structure
Create a new component `SlidesEmbed.astro` that:
- Accepts parsed slides array with paths and titles
- Accepts configuration object
- Renders an iframe pointing to the reveal.js presentation route
- Handles responsive sizing and aspect ratio

#### 4. URL Construction
The embed component should construct URLs like:
```
/slides/embed?slides=essays/intro.md,essays/chapter1.md&theme=dark&transition=slide
```

Or use a POST request / session storage for complex configurations.

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| theme | string | 'black' | Reveal.js theme name |
| transition | string | 'slide' | Transition style (none/fade/slide/convex/concave/zoom) |
| controls | boolean | true | Show control arrows |
| progress | boolean | true | Show progress bar |
| autoSlide | number | 0 | Auto-advance slides (milliseconds, 0 = disabled) |
| loop | boolean | false | Loop presentation |
| width | string | '100%' | Embed width |
| height | string | '600px' | Embed height |

### Example Rendered Output
The parsed content should render as:
```html
<div class="presentation-embed">
  <iframe 
    src="/slides/embed?slides=..." 
    width="100%" 
    height="600px"
    frameborder="0"
    allowfullscreen
  />
</div>
```

### Error Handling
- If a linked markdown file doesn't exist, show a warning in development
- Gracefully skip missing files in production
- Validate configuration options and use defaults for invalid values

### Security Considerations
- Sanitize all paths to prevent directory traversal
- Validate that linked files are within allowed content directories
- Escape all user-provided configuration values

### Future Enhancements
- Support for speaker notes syntax
- Ability to specify individual slide transitions
- Support for slide-specific themes
- Export to PDF functionality from embedded view
