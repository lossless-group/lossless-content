1. The CSV (“Yearly-TimeTable-CSV.csv”) is structured with a header row that defines the following columns:
  • Timeframe_ID
  • Year
  • HQMM-String
  • Half
  • Quarter
  • Month
  • Month-String

2. The file then lists 12 rows (one per timeframe), for example:
  • Row 1: "2023-H1-Q1-01" is the Timeframe_ID, the Year is 2023, HQMM-String is "H1-Q1-01", Half is "H1", Quarter is "Q1", Month is 1, and Month-String is also “1.”
  • Row 2: "2023-H1-Q1-02" with corresponding fields.
  • Row 3: "2023-H1-Q1-03"
  • Row 4: "2023-H1-Q2-04"
  • Row 5: "2023-H1-Q2-05"
  • Row 6: "2023-H1-Q2-06"
  • Row 7: "2023-H2-Q3-07"
  • Row 8: "2023-H2-Q3-08"
  • Row 9: "2023-H2-Q3-09"
  • Row 10: "2023-H2-Q4-10"
  • Row 11: "2023-H2-Q4-11"
  • Row 12: "2023-H2-Q4-12"

3. Each row appears to represent a different timeframe within the year 2023, showing details about which half (H1 or H2), quarter (Q1, Q2, etc.) and month the timeframe belongs to. The columns “Month” and “Month-String” appear to be numeric (e.g., 1, 2, …) and text representations of the same month number.

4. In comparison, the PDF version of this data (“Yearly-TimeTable-CSV.pdf”) seems to be a less structured extract. It appears that the header is concatenated (for example, “Timeframe_IDYearHQMM-StringHalfQuarterMonthMonth-String”) and each row’s fields are merged together (such as “2023-H1-Q1-012023H1-Q1-01H1Q111”). This is likely due to the way the PDF conversion or extraction process worked, making it harder to parse without additional text processing.

In summary, yes I can read the CSV document: It is a well-structured file containing time period details for 2023. If you need to work further on this data (for example, importing it into Excel, splitting the PDF content back into columns, or performing calculations based on these values), let me know the details and I can help guide you through those steps.
