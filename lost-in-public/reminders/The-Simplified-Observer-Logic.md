# Logic:

1. The Observer is supposed to orchestrate subsystems. 
2. The Observer is supposed to "ask" the "subsystem" if it should expect returned data.
3. The Observer lauches a "propertyCollector" that receives "expectations" from the "subsystem" and "results" from the "subsystem".
4. The Observer NEVER EVER EVER WRITES, NOT ONCE, UTNIL ALL PROPERTIES ARE RECEIVED FROM THE SUBSUSYSTEMS.
- The Observer should have a record of what to "Expect" from the subsystems.  It does not write to file until everything is back, or an error is back in their stead. 
5. The Observer updates the frontmatter with the results from the "propertyCollector".
