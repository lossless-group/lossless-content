# Specification Development Guidelines

## Purpose
This is a reminder to frequently refer to the specification template and guidelines. They are designed to:

1. **Standardize Documentation**: Create a consistent structure across all technical specifications
2. **Enable AI Assistance**: Make specifications easily parsable by AI systems for better code generation and analysis
3. **Facilitate Maintenance**: Make it easier to update and extend specifications over time
4. **Improve Onboarding**: Help new contributors understand the project's technical landscape

## When to Reference?
Attempting to plan a new specification, or to revise an existing specification.

## Specification Template
`content/lost-in-public/reminders/Specification-Guidelines-Template.md`

# Focal Points and Key Tasks:

1. Each section and header is important to include, no lazy skipping.
2. Each specification should make use of backlinks to other documentation and specifications. Use paths and backlinks where relevant.
3. Specifications should have liberal use of mermaid diagrams and code snippets.
