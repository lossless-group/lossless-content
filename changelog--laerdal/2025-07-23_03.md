# Summary
Implemented an ultra-cool splash screen with modern CSS animations and enhanced the PerplexityConfig component with custom properties generation capabilities for AI-powered record augmentation.

## Why Care
The splash screen creates a professional first impression with engaging animations that showcase the app's core workflow. The custom properties feature significantly expands the AI augmentation capabilities, allowing users to define specific data points they want generated for each record, making the tool much more flexible and powerful for business intelligence workflows.

## Technical Details

### Splash Screen Implementation (`src/components/SplashScreen.js`)

**Animation System:**
- Phase-based animation control with 4 distinct phases (0-3)
- 1-second intervals between phases for optimal visual rhythm
- 6-second total duration with smooth fade-out transition

**Key Features:**
- Gradient background: `bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-900 via-purple-900 to-indigo-900`
- Floating animated orbs with staggered pulse delays
- Staggered text animations: Welcome text slides down, tagline slides up
- Icon animations: Bounce-in effects for Import/Augment/Export, spin-in for Repeat
- Loading indicator with bouncing dots
- Floating database icon with continuous float animation

**Animation Classes Added:**
```css
.animate-slideInDown, .animate-slideInUp, .animate-slideOutUp
.animate-fadeOut, .animate-fadeIn, .animate-bounceIn
.animate-spinIn, .animate-float
```

### Custom Properties Feature (`src/components/PerplexityConfig.js`)

**New Functionality:**
- Dynamic custom properties management with add/remove capabilities
- Real-time placeholder preview in prompt editor
- Integration with existing Perplexity AI configuration
- Visual distinction between CSV fields and custom properties

**Key Components:**
- Custom properties input with Enter key support
- Property list with individual remove buttons
- Purple-themed styling for custom properties
- Instructions panel explaining the workflow

**State Management:**
- `newProperty` state for input field
- Integration with existing `perplexityConfig.customProperties` array
- Validation to prevent duplicate properties

### CSS Animations (`src/app/globals.css`)

**Custom Keyframes:**
```css
@keyframes slideInDown, slideInUp, slideOutUp
@keyframes fadeOut, fadeIn, bounceIn, spinIn, float
```

**Animation Classes:**
- Smooth transitions with `ease-out` timing
- Configurable durations (0.8s - 3s)
- Transform-based animations for performance
- Opacity and scale effects for visual impact

### Page Integration (`src/app/page.js`)

**State Management:**
- `showSplash` state controls splash screen visibility
- `handleSplashComplete` callback manages transition
- Conditional rendering with React Fragment

## Integration Points

### Splash Screen Integration:
- Seamlessly integrates with existing RecordCollector component
- No impact on existing functionality
- Maintains app state during splash display
- Smooth transition to main application

### Custom Properties Integration:
- Extends existing PerplexityConfig store functionality
- Integrates with `availableFields` from record store
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing prompts
- Enhances AI augmentation workflow

### Animation System:
- Custom CSS animations work alongside Tailwind utilities
- No conflicts with existing styling
- Performance-optimized with transform-based animations
- Responsive design maintained across screen sizes

## Documentation

### Splash Screen Usage:
The splash screen automatically displays on page load for 6 seconds, then transitions to the main application. No user interaction required.

### Custom Properties Usage:
1. Navigate to PerplexityConfig component
2. Add custom properties in the "Custom Properties to Generate" section
3. Properties appear as placeholders in the prompt editor
4. AI will research and generate these properties for each record

### Animation Customization:
All animations are defined in `src/app/globals.css` and can be modified by adjusting:
- Keyframe definitions for animation behavior
- Animation class durations and timing functions
- Phase timing in SplashScreen component

### API Integration:
Custom properties integrate with Perplexity AI API through the existing prompt system, allowing dynamic property generation based on user-defined requirements.
