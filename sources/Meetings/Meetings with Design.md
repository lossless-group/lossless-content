## 2025-01-08 Meeting with [[Troels Villumsen]]

We discussed the need for a clear and streamlined process to get our [[client-content/Laerdal/Projects/03 - Design Work]] into the [[Life Design System]].  
## 2025-01-09 with [[Hector Mejia]]

#### Do you also work in assets like posters and presentations and screens around the office?  
Not really.  It involves mobilizing many different disparate teams.  


#### How does Marketing use the design system?  Do they use it for the website?  Who builds and maintains the marketing website?  
No idea.  [[Darlene Giordano]] from [[Laerdal Marketing]]



Is a [[UI-Kit]] in [[Tooling/Figma]].  A few years ago "one of the business units" started they were building a [[UI-Kit]] in [[React]].  The Design team in Copenhagen wants to implement universal [[Design Systems]].  There seem to be 3 different [[UI-Kit]]s, platform called [[Copenhagen Office]] 

No clear Guidelines, design components for [[Enrique Liel Brand Director]], [[Lande Lombard Art Director]].  They use [[SharePoint]], and [[Troels Villumsen]] believes it should live in the [[Design Systems]].  [[concepts/Divergence and Convergence]].

Currently organized that the 

[[Cansu Akarsu]]. [[Data & AI]] 
[[Troels Villumsen]] wants a developer that is dedicated to delivering the design system.  Connective tissue.  [[Slow Down to Speed Up]] 

###  Do people find you through [[SharePoint]]? 

Different from Site to Site.  [[Insights Library]]
Hard to find the right place.  Useful but a big mess. 
No mass adoption of [[Tooling/Productivity/Microsoft Loop]].  
Who decides the editorial for [[SharePoint]], [[Brand and Corporate Communication]] -- [[Paal Oftedal]] 
[[Jill Reid]]

### Do you have separate files where you keep various tokens?   
We've found it's helpful to have consistent components just to display aspects of [[Design Systems]].  Been working with [[Design Tokens]] for the past year.  New for the product teams.  
Colors, Gradients
Lines
Spacing
Shadows, etc

### How do you collect "inspiration" from other wild examples? 


### Who do you report to and present to?  What context do they have on the importance of what you are doing? 


### Are you using any AI based design anything?  
Like [[Creatie]], or [[CopyCoder]], [[UIzard]], [[UX Pilot]], [[Tooling/Software Development/DevOps/Developer Experience/Luny AI]], [[v0]], 





### How would creating and maintaining UI Libraries outside of React work?  
[[emergent-innovation/Standards/Web Components]], [[Svelte]], [[Solid.js]], [[Vue.js]]?  Do you think the current NPM library will work?  No clear maintainer for how [[UI-Kit]]s get into the [[concepts/Explainers for Tooling/Web Frameworks]].  [[Digital Business Unit]]



Separation 



### What is the Step by Step to get assets into the Design System?
Do we need any invitations to anything in specific?  
[[Mastery Library File]] , [[Extension Libraries]], happy to work with Sarah
