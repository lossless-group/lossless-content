Meetings related to the use of [[Salesforce]]. 

## 2024-12-11 meeting with [[Brage Vik]]

This meeting was brief, but I can surmise you have a "Salesforce" champion and enthusiast in [[Brage Vik]], which is great!  Salesforce is a beast.  Anyone willing to own it enthusiastically should be given a medal.

However, [[Salesforce]] is has tentacles that will wrap around and through any organization. It is an extensible platform. It pretends to be best-in-class for all kinds of business operations for which it is not really the easiest, cheapest, or best solution.  It's very common for businesses to get lost in a quagmire of consultants reconfiguring Salesforce to do other things in a quixotic quest to "align on one platform."  

Salesforce is both a "modular" and a "seat-based" solution, and it is priced the same. So there is always something pretty cool or even slightly crucial they Salesforce will want to upsell customers. The more functionality you add, and the more people have seats to Salesforce, the more Laerdal gets billed.  Trying to keep Salesforce costs down is a whole endeavor.  

All of the questions I had about the data are answered in Salesforce, which means that I should have received an account from the beginning.   

The "Owner of Salesforce" is so enthusiastic he seems to think that Salesforce will win the AI race for Enterprise AI. I can assure you that unless they acquire well, which is possible but not probable, they will not win the Enterprise AI race. 

We were able to inspire him to think about using AI to generate **structured note forms** for Sales teams, and clean the notes Sales creates while in the field using AI.
