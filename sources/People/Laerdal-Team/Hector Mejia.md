Needing a Laerdal email to get access to Dovetail.  

Might be able to use Channels.  

Dovetail doesn't pull in from [[Teams]]

Could help Sales teams on [[Design Interviews]] 

[[Design Research]] 

Creating a dashboard on top of [[Organizations/Dovetail]] that shows the "comprehensiveness" of the data.  

Can use [[Tooling/Productivity/Microsoft Loop]] as an [[Advanced Documents 1]].  

[[Design Ops]], [[Kevin Fox]] is part of the [[Digital Business Unit]].  

Organization would benefit from a universal stack.
