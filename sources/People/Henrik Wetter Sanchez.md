Henrik Wetter Sanchez’s career began during his undergraduate years at Cambridge, where he founded a tech startup, a social enterprise, and started angel investing through crowdfunding platforms. [^afr3gz] His early ventures included **RendezVu**, a social navigation and discovery startup that reached over a thousand global users, and the **Oxbridge Initiative**, an access-led tutoring platform live in six countries. [^afr3gz] These experiences laid a foundation for his later work in scaling businesses and supporting founders through complex challenges.

After roles in private equity (Ardian, Paris) and investment banking (Bank of America Merrill Lynch, London), Henrik joined Playfair Capital for the launch of its second fund in 2019. [^afr3gz] At Playfair, his investment focus spans **pre-seed to Series A rounds**, with active board seats in companies such as **Bryo, NetFabric, Passionfruit, Protex AI, Recurse ML, Recycleye, Those Beyond, Trezy,** and **Valarian**. [^afr3gz] Notably, Henrik’s angel investing track record features early bets on major fintech successes like **Monzo**, **GoHenry**, **Revolut**, **Freetrade**, and environmental platform **Pod Point**.

Henrik advocates for practical, founder-focused support beyond capital. He frequently engages with entrepreneurs to help set strategies, develop products, and navigate follow-on fundraising. [^afr3gz] Furthermore, he co-founded and leads Playfair’s diversity and inclusion program, **Female Founder Office Hours**, designed to address barriers faced by underrepresented founders in accessing funding and mentoring.

The impact of Henrik’s approach is visible in the diverse portfolios he manages and the notable exits and IPOs of his investments. His judicious use of AI and data-driven decision making is exemplified by recent investments in AI-focused startups like **Warden AI** (2024, 2025), demonstrating adaptability to emerging trends.
