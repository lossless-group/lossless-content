**Who is Ben Peters and What is Notion VC?**  
Ben Peters is a seasoned **venture capitalist** and entrepreneur with extensive experience in guiding high-growth startups. Notion VC, where Peters is a partner, was founded by former SaaS entrepreneurs and focuses on helping early-stage software companies grow, particularly by enabling them to enter and succeed in international markets, especially the US. The firm prides itself on being “by founders, for founders,” and this founder-centric approach permeates its investment philosophy and operational support.

Notion VC has backed numerous SaaS companies that have risen to prominence, such as GoCardless, Paddle, and Tradeshift. These companies are reshaping industries by offering digital solutions to long-standing business problems—GoCardless, for example, simplifies recurring payment collections across borders, while [[vertical-toolkits/FinTech/Paddle]] innovates in software monetization for SaaS providers. Peters and the Notion team provide hands-on mentorship, leveraging their own operational backgrounds to guide founders through internationalization, product scaling, and fundraising rounds, particularly those that require engaging with US investors or customers.

The key benefit of Ben Peters’s approach at Notion VC lies in the combination of capital and deep sector expertise. Startups gain not only funding, but also access to a global network, go-to-market strategies for North America, and practical knowledge for overcoming the unique scaling challenges faced by European startups. [^lw4eki] The firm’s focus on business software means it plays a vital role in enabling digital transformation for clients across industries, from financial services to logistics and beyond.

However, European SaaS founders face significant challenges. These include competing for attention in a market long dominated by US VCs, navigating differing regulatory environments, and bridging the talent gap when entering new territories. Notion VC addresses these by cultivating a “transatlantic mindset” early—in other words, preparing portfolio companies for global scale from inception, not as an afterthought. [^lw4eki]

**Current Trends**

Venture capital in Europe has matured rapidly in recent years, with a growing number of SaaS startups achieving unicorn status and successfully expanding overseas. Notion VC, led by partners like Peters, is at the forefront of this trend, catalyzing the European SaaS ecosystem and helping founders access both capital and international markets.

**Key Players and Recent Developments**  
Where VCs in Europe once lagged behind Silicon Valley in scale and ambition, firms like Notion, [[vertical-toolkits/Venture-Capital-Firms/Index Ventures]], and [[vertical-toolkits/Venture-Capital-Firms/Atomico]] are closing the gap. Peters’s strategic focus echoes trends highlighted in sector analyses, including the importance of building business foundations for transatlantic expansion from day one—an approach now widely imitated in the European investment community.
