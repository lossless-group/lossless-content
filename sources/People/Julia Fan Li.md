Julia Fan Li is Co-Founder & CEO of Micrographia Bio, an AI-first life sciences company with a mission to deliver a new era of drug discovery using spatial proteomics at the nanoscale. Prior to Micrographia Bio, she was at the forefront of the genomics revolution, leading scale-up efforts for Seven Bridges Genomics in the UK.  
  
Stemming from her PhD in innovative finance for global health at Cambridge University, she previously was Co-Founder of the Global Health investment Fund - a pioneering $108mm late-stage venture fund to invest in therapeutics, vaccines, diagnostics and devices for diseases which disproportionately affect low and middle-income countries. The GHIF (now part of GHIC) was launched at UNGA in September 2013 by Bill Gates and Jamie Dimon.  
  
Julia obtained her B.Comm (double major in finance and immunology) from UBC and worked in healthcare financial services as a Chartered Accountant across four continents. She is passionate about drug discovery and innovative finance structures that can accelerate biomedical R&D. In the community, Julia serves on the Board of Trustees of the Gates Cambridge Scholarships at the University of Cambridge and the London TELUS community board.
