**Main Content**

Henry de Zoete’s journey began with co-founding The Big Deal in 2014, a platform that leveraged technology to facilitate collective bargaining for consumers, particularly in the highly competitive energy sector. [^yvjmm5] [^7bcr6s] [^yippr7] By organizing consumers together, The Big Deal negotiated better rates and terms with energy providers, highlighting how **technology can democratize access to better deals for the average person**—a key principle of de Zoete’s work.

Building on this momentum, de Zoete co-founded Look After My Bills in 2018, a groundbreaking auto-switching service designed to save UK families money on gas and electricity bills. [^yvjmm5] [^7bcr6s] [^yippr7] The service used a blend of automation and data-driven analytics to monitor the energy market and seamlessly switch customers to the cheapest suppliers each year. This innovation not only protected consumers from unexpectedly high tariff increases but also simplified a complex and often intimidating process. The company’s clear value proposition led them to secure the most successful deal in BBC’s Dragons’ Den history before being acquired by GoCo Group PLC (owners of GoCompare) in 2019.

De Zoete’s ventures underscore several practical use cases:  
- **Consumer savings through automation**: Families routinely saved hundreds of pounds per year without manual effort.  
- **Data-driven decision-making**: The platforms seamlessly analyzed vast datasets to optimize outcomes for users.  
- **Collective bargaining power**: Individuals benefited by joining larger groups, proving technology can enhance negotiating strength.

These efforts have brought considerable benefits, such as increasing transparency, reducing consumer inertia, and fostering competition among service providers. They also demonstrate the **potential of technology-enabled social innovation**, inspiring other technologists to tackle similarly entrenched problems.

However, the journey was not without challenges. Building consumer trust in automated financial decision-making, managing evolving data privacy regulations, and ensuring platform security were significant considerations. Additionally, the startup’s pivot from their original business model to a fully automated solution required resilience and ongoing attention to market feedback. [^yippr7]

Today, Henry de Zoete is a well-established investor and advisor, using his experience to fuel the next generation of tech start-ups as a prolific angel investor with over 50 portfolio companies.
