**Geoffrey Hinton** is a British-Canadian cognitive psychologist and computer scientist recognized as a central pioneer in the field of **artificial intelligence (AI)**, particularly for his work on **neural networks** and **deep learning**[3][1][2][4]. The media and academic circles often refer to him as the *“godfather of AI.”*

## Why is he considered the "godfather of AI"?

- **Pioneering Neural Networks:** Hinton was instrumental in advancing neural network research, especially at a time when much of mainstream AI research had dismissed them as impractical[1][3][4]. His theoretical advocacy rekindled global interest in neural networks after a period of skepticism, directly shaping today’s deep learning revolution[1].
- **Backpropagation Algorithm:** With David Rumelhart, Hinton developed and popularized the **backpropagation algorithm**, critical for training multi-layer neural networks[3][4]. This innovation laid the groundwork for modern AI systems in speech, image, and language recognition[3][4].
- **Deep Learning Breakthroughs:** Hinton’s research group in Toronto developed methods and architectures that enabled deep neural networks to outperform traditional machine learning techniques, revolutionizing object classification and speech recognition[4][1].
- **Boltzmann Machines and Unsupervised Learning:** He invented **Boltzmann machines**, significantly advancing unsupervised learning and generative modeling—cornerstones of modern AI’s capacity to extract insights from raw data and generate new content[2][4].
- **Distributed Representations:** Hinton introduced the idea of representing information across many nodes in a network, facilitating more powerful and efficient machine learning architectures[4].
- **Recognition and Awards:** In 2024, Hinton received the **Nobel Prize in Physics** (shared with John Hopfield) for his fundamental work in neural network theory and application, underscoring his lasting impact on both AI and broader scientific inquiry, such as drug discovery and protein folding[1].

## Major Research and Key Publications

- **Backpropagation (1986):** Co-authored “Learning representations by back-propagating errors,” the foundational paper on backpropagation.
- **Boltzmann Machines (1985):** Developed the theoretical and practical underpinnings for stochastic neural networks capable of learning internal data representation[2][4].
- **Deep Belief Networks (2006):** Pioneered multi-layer unsupervised learning models, central to the modern resurgence of deep learning.
- **Distributed Representations:** Proposed ways neural nets could efficiently encode complex data, influencing word embeddings and language models[4].
- His group’s breakthroughs led directly to advances in **speech recognition**, **object classification**, **natural language processing**, and **medical imaging**[3][1][4].

## Perspectives on AI and LLMs Since 2023

- **Concern About Risks:** Since 2023, following rapid advances in *large language models (LLMs)* like ChatGPT and generative AI, Hinton has become more vocal about the **ethical, societal, and existential risks** posed by advanced AI.
- He has warned of the **potential for AI to surpass human intelligence**, raising alarms about loss of control, misinformation, and workforce disruption—a notable shift from his previously optimistic focus on technical potential[1].
- Hinton emphasizes the urgent need for *regulation and international collaboration* to guide AI’s societal impact.

### Resources: Interviews, Academic, and Mainstream Media

**Academic and Background Sources:**
- SBMI Blog (2024): In-depth on Nobel and deep learning impact[1].
- BBVA Foundation (2024): Awards and technical summary[3].
- Datategy (2024): Boltzmann Machine and unsupervised learning explained[2].
- Vector Institute: Research contributions and neural net breakthroughs[4].

**Media Interviews and Talks:**  
- While not linked directly here (per guidelines), Hinton has appeared in numerous major media and YouTube interviews recently. Notable appearances include:
  - 2023 interviews with BBC, The New York Times, Reuters, and The Guardian, all covering his views on the risks and regulation needs for advanced AI.
  - YouTube: Search for “Geoffrey Hinton AI godfather interview 2023” for a series of in-depth discussions following his resignation from Google (Spring 2023), where he outlined his concerns over the pace and stewardship of AI advancements.

**In summary:** Hinton is revered for **reinvigorating neural networks**, unlocking deep learning’s power, and fueling AI’s integration into real-world technologies. In recent years, he has shifted from technical focus to advocacy, **warning about AI’s risks** and urging careful stewardship of its future development[1][3][4].
