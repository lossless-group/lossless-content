description_site_cp: This book combines two proven approaches from MIT—the globally recognized Disciplined Entrepreneurship framework and the specialized curriculum of MIT's Climate and Energy Ventures course. We've adapted both these elements into a single, highly accessible set of steps. Our framework provides a comprehensive and easy to understand guide for building a venture that is successful financially, socially, and environmentally. DE4CEV is a go-to reference text that is both entertaining and practical for aspiring startup founders as well as entrepreneurial changemakers working within larger institutions, like established companies, government, and nonprofits.
