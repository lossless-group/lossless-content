**Machines Who Think** by Pamela McCorduck is a comprehensive history and personal exploration of **artificial intelligence (AI)**, tracing the discipline’s origins, key figures, philosophical challenges, and major technological milestones. [^s8g2b2] [^wc05j9] [^2mpf31] The book serves as both an informative chronicle and a reflective inquiry into the quest to create machines that mimic or surpass human intelligence.

The book is organized into several thematic parts:
- **Beginnings**: Examines early ideas about mechanized thinking, drawing on ancient philosophy and mythology to reveal humanity’s long fascination with artificial minds.

- **The Turning Point**: Focuses on the mid-20th-century breakthroughs in computing and logic, especially the work of pioneers like Alan Turing, John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, and Herbert Simon, who laid the conceptual and technical foundations for AI as an academic discipline. [^s8g2b2] [^wc05j9]
- **Resistance**: Discusses the skepticism and cultural pushback AI research has faced, from technical barriers to social anxieties about the implications of artificial minds.
- **Realizations**: Chronicles the emerging applications and achievements of AI, including early expert systems, pattern recognition, and practical industrial uses, which signaled the field’s maturing influence. [^2mpf31]

- **The Tensions of Choice**: Explores ethical dilemmas, the unpredictable growth of technology, and the enduring debate about whether "machines who think" will complement or threaten human society.

**Key themes include:**
- The audacious goal to replicate human cognition in machines and what that means for our understanding of intelligence.
- The interdisciplinary nature of AI, connecting computer science, philosophy, neuroscience, psychology, and ethics.
- The personal stories, dreams, and sometimes frustrations of those who have shaped AI’s development.

The book is widely regarded as the **seminal narrative** on AI’s formative years, praised for its historical breadth, engaging storytelling, and ability to give readers a sense of both the excitement and repercussions of artificial intelligence. [^wc05j9] The edition includes timelines, afterwords covering more recent developments, and extensive bibliographic material.

**Machines Who Think** remains a key reference for understanding not just the technical evolution of AI, but also its shifting social context and the enduring questions it raises about the nature of mind and machine. [^s8g2b2] [^wc05j9]
