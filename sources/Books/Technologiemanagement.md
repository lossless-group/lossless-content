## Chapter 1: The Framework for Production and Management

This chapter introduces a comprehensive framework derived from the St. Gallen Management Model, adapted specifically for manufacturing companies. The framework structures three main dimensions: internal business aspects (company structure, development, and processes), stakeholder groups (customers, employees, suppliers, competitors, etc.), and environmental spheres (society, nature, technology, economy, norms and values). The company structure encompasses organizational design, resources, information systems, and culture. Company development includes strategy, development modes, and finance/controlling. The business processes cover technology-oriented and business processes that transform inputs into outputs. The framework emphasizes that companies exist to create value for stakeholders through interactions, while being influenced by broader environmental factors. This systematic approach helps understand the complex relationships within manufacturing enterprises and provides a foundation for the subsequent technology management concepts.

## Chapter 2: Introduction and Delineation

This chapter establishes technology management as a strategic planning function focused on long-term market positioning through targeted changes in technology, products, or production processes. Technology management aims to provide required technologies (product, production, and material technologies) at the right time and appropriate costs to secure competitive advantages. The chapter differentiates technology management from related disciplines: while technology management focuses on technological capabilities, innovation management centers on concrete products. R&D management represents the intersection between technology and innovation management. Technology management encompasses acquisition, storage, and utilization of technological knowledge, whether developed internally or acquired externally. The authors emphasize that technology management is not necessarily a specialized organizational unit but rather a cross-functional responsibility distributed throughout technology-intensive companies. The chapter addresses the increasing importance of systematic technology management as technical progress accelerates and product lifecycles shorten.

## Chapter 3: Technology Management Framework

This chapter develops a detailed framework specifically for technology management as part of the broader production and management system. The framework identifies relevant stakeholder groups including external parties (competitors, suppliers, customers, government, public) and internal functions (R&D, production, purchasing, management, marketing, sales, personnel, service, logistics, finance). The core technology management processes include: technology intelligence (early identification of technological developments), technology planning (operationalizing technology strategy), technology development (implementing planned technologies), technology utilization (internal and external technology exploitation), technology protection (safeguarding technological knowledge), and technology assessment (evaluating technologies throughout all phases). The chapter extensively discusses organizational anchoring options, from implicit integration across departments to explicit forms like committees, project organizations, staff functions, line integration, centers, or external service providers. A case study from the automotive industry illustrates matrix organization along production areas and technology fields. The framework emphasizes technology strategy as the central element of business development.

## Chapter 4: Fundamentals of Technology Management

This chapter establishes the conceptual foundation of technology management by exploring:

**Technology vs. Technique**: The chapter distinguishes between technology (knowledge, skills, and capabilities for solving technical problems) and technique (the materialization/application of technology). It adopts an integrative understanding where technique is viewed as a subsystem of technology.

**Technology Classification Systems**: Technologies can be categorized by:

- Application area/function (product, production, material technologies)
- Interdependencies (individual vs. system technologies, complementary vs. competing technologies)
- Application breadth across industries (cross-cutting vs. specialized technologies)
- Internal application scope and competitive potential (core competence vs. peripheral technologies)
- Product relationship (core vs. supporting technologies)
- Lifecycle phase (pacemaker, key, basic, displaced technologies)

**Technology Lifecycle Models**: Several models are examined:

- Ford and Ryan's 6-phase model tracking technology diffusion over time
- Ansoff's model distinguishing stable, dynamic, and turbulent technology development
- Gartner's Hype Cycle showing expectations vs. time
- McKinsey's S-curve concept relating performance to cumulative R&D investment
- Arthur D. Little's lifecycle classification system

**Technology Diffusion**: The chapter explores how technologies spread through markets, covering adoption theory and the factors influencing technology acceptance (relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, observability).

## Chapter 5: Technology Strategy

This chapter focuses on developing and implementing technology strategies:

**Strategic Foundations**: Technology strategy is grounded in resource-based theory and core competence approaches, emphasizing inside-out perspective for technology-oriented companies.

**Five Key Dimensions of Technology Strategy**:

1. **Technology Selection**: Which technologies to pursue
2. **Technological Performance Level**: Leadership vs. presence strategies
3. **Technology Timing**: Pioneer vs. follower approaches
4. **Technology Source**: Internal development vs. external acquisition (make-or-buy)
5. **Technology Utilization**: Internal use vs. external commercialization (keep-or-sell)

**Strategic Context**: Technology strategies must align with corporate, business unit, competitive, and functional strategies. The chapter emphasizes the interconnected nature of these strategic levels.

**Development Process**: A five-step process for developing technology strategy:

1. Internal analysis of technology base
2. External analysis of technology environment
3. Technology field differentiation
4. Strategy formulation across dimensions
5. Consistency checking
