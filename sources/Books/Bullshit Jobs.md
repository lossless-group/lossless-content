The meme of [[Bullshit Jobs]] burst onto the Internet in 2013.  A term coined by anthropologist and political activist [[David Graeber]], described what a surprisingly large number of knowledge workers were feeling -- that they themselves and many people they knew secretly believe their role and their job do not need to exist at all. They in no way contributes to either organizational value creation or have any positive impact to society.

[[David Graeber]] did rough napkin math, with very little rigor, but estimated that around 50% of jobs are [[Bullshit Jobs]], and nearly half of those remaining spend significant time and energy dealing with unproductive or counterproductive tasks and issues. Later surveys validated a smaller -- but still alarming -- number, in which 37% of British workers thought their jobs did not contribute 'meaningfully' to the world, and 19% of Americans said the same thing.  

in some ways related to [[Parkinson's Law]], which states that work will always bee created in order to fill the time of available employees, and to the [[Theory of Constraints]], which states that any investment outside of your primary business constraint will only create rationales for more unproductive investment and team building.
