The meme of [[Bullshit Jobs]] burst onto the Internet in 2013.  A term coined by anthropologist and political activist [[David Graeber]], described what a surprisingly large number of knowledge workers were feeling -- that they themselves and many people they knew secretly believe their role and their job do not need to exist at all. They in no way contributes to either organizational value creation or have any positive impact to society.

[[David Graeber]] did rough napkin math, with very little rigor, but estimated that around 50% of jobs are [[Bullshit Jobs]], and nearly half of those remaining spend significant time and energy dealing with unproductive or counterproductive tasks and issues. Later surveys validated a smaller -- but still alarming -- number, in which 37% of British workers thought their jobs did not contribute 'meaningfully' to the world, and 19% of Americans said the same thing.  

in some ways related to [[Parkinson's Law]], which states that work will always bee created in order to fill the time of available employees, and to the [[concepts/Theory of Constraints|Theory of Constraints]], which states that any investment outside of your primary business constraint will only create rationales for more unproductive investment and team building.

**Bullshit Jobs: A Theory** by David Graeber argues that a significant share of modern work is meaningless, offering little to no societal value and causing psychological harm to those performing it. [^4534d9] [^qbc272] [^34sr0n] [^63pkfl] Graeber identifies *five archetypes* of these "bullshit jobs," each with distinct features and social roles.

### Core Thesis and Context

Graeber contends that **many modern jobs exist purely for appearances or bureaucratic reasons** rather than actual necessity. While occupations like janitors and nurses are undervalued yet essential, entire sectors—especially in large organizations—are filled with roles that neither improve society nor create real value. [^4534d9] [^qbc272] [^34sr0n] Graeber describes the psychological toll these jobs take, highlighting how the awareness of pointlessness leads to misery and a sense of purposelessness for workers. [^4534d9] [^qbc272] [^63pkfl]

He explores **why these jobs proliferate**, attributing it to a new kind of "managerial feudalism" in which organizations bloat hierarchies as a form of power and prestige rather than efficiency or utility. [^sog13r]

### The Five Archetypes of Bullshit Jobs

**Graeber classifies meaningless jobs into five key archetypes**: [^4534d9] [^qbc272] [^63pkfl]

| Archetype       | Description                                                                                                                                                      | Example                                                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Flunkies**    | Their role is to make others feel important, not to accomplish valuable work.                                                                                    | Receptionists with no tasks, doormen in empty buildings.                   |
| **Goons**       | Their purpose involves aggressive tactics, manipulation, or defense within an adversarial system, justified only by others doing the same.                       | Corporate lawyers, lobbyists, telemarketers.                               |
| **Duct Tapers** | These workers temporarily fix problems that exist because of organizational inefficiency, rather than addressing root causes.                                    | Employees who patch up software bugs caused by bad design.                 |
| **Box Tickers** | Their job is to create paperwork or processes to give the appearance that something useful is being done, usually to satisfy regulations or performance metrics. | Filling forms for audits that no one reads, redundant compliance officers. |
| **Taskmasters** | Managers whose main contribution is to assign work or create unnecessary layers of supervision, sometimes inventing new pointless tasks for others.              | Mid-level managers in over-bureaucratized organizations.                   |

#### Explanation of Archetypes

- **Flunkies** exist solely to support or inflate the status of others, with their own productivity irrelevant to the actual mission of the organization.
- **Goons** are necessary only because of competition or conflict, with entire professions sometimes existing merely as a response to others (for example, PR professionals or lobbyists would be unneeded without others in the same arms race).
- **Duct Tapers** do real work but only to compensate for avoidable problems. Their jobs would disappear if issues were properly fixed instead of patched over.
- **Box Tickers** focus on process over substance—generating reports, metrics, and documentation usually ignored or useless in practice.
- **Taskmasters** supervise without adding value or create pointless new tasks to justify their own role or team, exacerbating the problem.

### Broader Implications

Graeber links the rise of bullshit jobs to *social and economic arrangements that reward appearance and bureaucracy over substance*. He suggests that the association of work with self-worth, a historically recent development, helps explain why people tolerate such roles despite their existential emptiness. [^4534d9] [^sog13r] [^34sr0n] He further advocates for systemic solutions, such as **universal basic income** and **labor rights**, to address the harm caused by meaningless employment. [^4534d9]

#### Key Insights

- There is an **inverse relationship between social value and pay**: jobs critical to society are often the least rewarded. [^34sr0n]
- Many workers cannot pursue meaningful jobs due to poor compensation or systemic undervaluation. [^qbc272]
- The *perceived uselessness* of one's work correlates with lower wellbeing, but empirical studies show only a minority (less than 20%) openly feel their jobs are useless, suggesting management and workplace culture play a major role in the sense of meaninglessness. [^4534d9]

Graeber's provocative argument challenges the purpose of modern employment structures and invites debate on how society values, and misvalues, human effort.
