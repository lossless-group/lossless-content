**What Technology Wants** is a book by Kevin Kelly that reframes technology as a living, evolving system, shaped by forces and imperatives similar to those in biological evolution. [^1imukt] [^0d08p6] [^n2qunq] The book’s central thesis is that technology (collectively termed the *technium*) has inherent tendencies and “wants” that are not just extensions of human desires, but emerge from its own integrated complexity. [^1imukt] [^0d08p6]

**Key Themes and Arguments:**

- **Technology as an Evolving Organism:** Kelly argues that technology should be seen as a quasi-living system. The *technium* behaves according to evolutionary principles, paralleling biological systems in how it grows, adapts, and seeks complexity and diversity over time. [^1imukt] [^0d08p6]
  
- **What Technology “Wants”:** The book proposes that technology has inclinations—such as increasing complexity, diversity, mutualism, and sentience—that guide its development. [^1imukt] [^0d08p6]

- **Historical and Futuristic Analysis:** By tracing 50,000 years of technological history and projecting into the future, Kelly identifies “trajectories” that show how certain outcomes and innovations are inevitable, given the system’s structure . [^1imukt]

- **Human Agency and Responsibility:** Although technology displays its own tendencies, humans remain co-evolutionary partners with it. Kelly urges that understanding these trajectories allows us to better align our values, educate ourselves and future generations, and proactively shape technologies for positive outcomes. [^1imukt] [^0d08p6]

- **Meaning and Opportunity:** The *technium* is ultimately presented as an amplifier of possibilities, enriching human life, meaning, and creativity by expanding the “adjacent possible”—the set of next-step innovations that current systems make viable. [^hb64vn] [^n2qunq]

**Practical Application:**
Kelly concludes with three lessons:
- Listen to what technology wants to prepare for inevitable change.
- Use principles of *proaction* (deliberate preparation and steering) and *engagement* (active participation) to maximize technology’s benefits.
- Align with the long-term imperatives of technology to harness its full potential for human flourishing. [^0d08p6]

**In summary**, *What Technology Wants* invites readers to see technology as an ecosystem with its own developmental path, encouraging both awe and responsibility in how humanity interacts with the ever-expanding *technium*.
