"Don't Make Me Think" by Steve Krug is a foundational book on **UI and UX design** that emphasizes the core principle: user interfaces should be so clear and self-explanatory that users can accomplish their goals *without having to think* about how to use them. [^k4pvfr] [^evb6m5] [^e6jxzr] Krug argues that **usability** is about making digital products intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable by minimizing friction and confusion for users.

Key principles and supporting details:

- **Clarity over cleverness**: Interfaces must be obvious and self-explanatory. Users should never have to puzzle over what to do next; each element’s purpose should be immediately clear. [^k4pvfr] [^evb6m5]

- **Satisficing behavior**: People look for quick, workable solutions rather than optimal ones. Good design leverages this by guiding users directly to their goals without unnecessary choices or clutter. [^k4pvfr] [^e6jxzr]

- **Navigation must be simple**: Effective navigation and site structures help users quickly find content or complete actions. Krug advocates for straightforward menus, logical paths, and visible cues. [^971hya]

- **Usability testing is essential**: The book stresses the importance of regular, practical usability testing. This can be done easily and inexpensively, allowing teams to iterate and catch issues early. [^k4pvfr] [^evb6m5] Krug’s sequel, "Rocket Surgery Made Easy," expands on testing methods.

- **Mobile and accessibility considerations**: Later editions include guidance for mobile interfaces, reinforcing that all users benefit from ease of use, not just desktop users. [^k4pvfr] [^e6jxzr]

- **Qualities of great UX**: The text outlines essential qualities: learnability, memorability, effectiveness, efficiency, desirability, and delight. [^aqppr5] A usable product should be easy to learn, remember, and use performantly and pleasantly.

  ![Additional supporting visual content — e.g., a checklist or flowchart of core usability questions (Is it learnable? Memorable? Effective? etc.) from the book.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gyjV8oY9_xQ/maxresdefault.jpg)

Other notable aspects:

- The book is intentionally concise and approachable, aimed at a wide audience beyond designers, including executives and developers. [^k4pvfr] [^evb6m5]
- Its advice is illustrated with humor, real-world examples (notably Amazon.com), and practical exercises, such as critiquing website layouts. [^aqppr5]
- Krug emphasizes the importance of putting yourself in the user’s shoes and designing from their perspective rather than the developer’s. [^971hya]

By championing simplicity and continuous user testing, "Don't Make Me Think" remains a cornerstone in teaching both the *what* and *why* of good UX and UI design.
