*Hooked* by Nir Eyal explains how companies create **habit-forming products** using the **Hook Model**, a four-step cycle designed to drive **repeated user engagement** and turn technology products into routines or habits. [^u7t9r7] [^as4h7m] [^colkz3] This model helps companies like Facebook, Google, and Instagram become first-to-mind solutions, where users return without needing reminders.

## **The Hook Model**

![Relevant diagram or illustration related to the topic](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iw1x0zos8Jo/maxresdefault.jpg)
The core framework of the book is the **Hook Model**, comprising four phases[^u7t9r7] [^as4h7m] [3]:

1. **Trigger:** 
   - Triggers start the habit loop. 
   - They can be **external** (e.g., notifications) or **internal** (e.g., boredom, loneliness). [^u7t9r7] [^as4h7m]

1. **Action:**
   - The user takes a simple action in anticipation of a reward (e.g., scrolling a feed, searching a term). [^u7t9r7] [^m2i396]
   - Making the action easy and frictionless is crucial (removing steps, minimizing effort). [^m2i396]

1. **Variable Reward:** 
   - Rewards are unpredictable and vary each time, increasing engagement (examples: new posts, likes, messages). [^as4h7m] [^colkz3] [^m2i396]
   - Eyal identifies three types of variable rewards:
     - **The Tribe:** Social rewards (connection, likes)
     - **The Hunt:** Material rewards (points, deals)
     - **The Self:** Personal satisfaction (completing a task). [^m2i396]

1. **Investment:** 
   - Users invest effort, data, or time, making them more likely to repeat the cycle (posting content, customizing profiles). [^u7t9r7] [^as4h7m]
   - This increases perceived value and commitment.

![Practical example or use case visualization](https://images2.penguinrandomhouse.com/smedia/9781591847786)
An example is **Instagram**:
- **Trigger:** Notification on your phone
- **Action:** Opening the app and scrolling
- **Variable Reward:** New posts, likes, stories
- **Investment:** Liking posts, leaving comments, uploading a photo

## **Why Habits Matter for Products**

- **Habit-forming products** ensure unprompted use, reducing marketing costs and increasing lifetime customer value. [^u7t9r7] [^as4h7m]
- Businesses benefit from faster growth, more pricing flexibility, and a competitive edge when their products become habitual. [^u7t9r7] [^as4h7m]
- This means users return automatically, such as checking Facebook when bored or searching via Google out of habit.

![Additional supporting visual content](https://dansilvestre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hooked-book-summary-scaled.jpeg)
Visuals might show a feedback loop or a graph plotting **frequency** (how often users engage) against **perceived utility** (how useful users find the product). Products in the "Habit Zone" have both high frequency and high utility. [^u7t9r7] [^as4h7m]

#### **Ethical Considerations**
- Eyal acknowledges the line between creating **helpful habits** and exploiting users by fostering dependency or addiction. [^i9h53u]
- He advises companies to focus on positive behavior change that serves users' interests, not just corporate gains. [^i9h53u]

| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Trigger**         | Cue starting behavior (internal/external) | Notification pops up        |
| **Action**          | Simple behavior anticipating reward       | Open app and scroll         |
| **Variable Reward** | Rewards that vary each time               | New likes/comments/stories  |
| **Investment**      | User invests effort/data/time             | Uploading photos/commenting |
