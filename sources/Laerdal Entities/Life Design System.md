Maintained by the [[Design]] team based in Copenhagen, reporting to [[Hector Mejia]].  The [[concepts/Single Point of Contact]] is [[Troels Villumsen]]. 

The [[Life Design System]] is [available as a package on npm at this link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@laerdal/life-react-components?activeTab=readme), and documented in [[Tooling/Software Development/Developer Experience/DevOps/Documentation Engines/Storybook]] at [this link](https://laerdal-components-storybook.azurewebsites.net/?path=/docs/components-accordion-accordionmenu--documentation).

The [[Design Systems]] in [[Tooling/Figma]] is comprehensive, but it is not being effectively used by all teams in Laerdal. 
The [[Digital Business Unit]] and [[Laerdal Labs]] tries to be compliant with the design system, with designers working with the Life library and developers using the React Library.
Main challenges and barriers for faster execution are legacy systems that cannot implement React components (e.g. LLEAP, initial e-commerce website).
Example of how we work around this: For the navigation project building blocks are created as web components, so they can be used across (as React is not compatible with Vue (e-commerce))

The [[Life Design System]] is a key part Laerdal implementing [[Vocabulary/Atomic Design|Atomic Design]]
