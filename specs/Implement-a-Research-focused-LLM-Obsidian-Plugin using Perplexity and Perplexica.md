image_prompt: A robot representing API calls is fishing off a boat. There are several fishing poles that have been cast onto a large representation of a web browser.  The web browser has a web page loaded with headers and images. The fishing lines are hooked into images and text and are pulling copies of them off the web browser page and towards the boat.

This is much cleaner than asking users to edit JavaScript code or JSON templates. The commands are discoverable, the interface is intuitive, and the results are automatically formatted in the editor. Users just need to:

1. Set their API keys in settings
2. Run the commands 
3. Ask their questions!

The plugin now provides a seamless AI-powered research experience directly in Obsidian! ðŸŽ‰
