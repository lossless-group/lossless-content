`session-close::'2025-03-19T04:51:05.362Z'`
`kebab-case` immediately followed by two colons followed by a value is Dataview Syntax. 

Rendered components should automagically hide Dataview Syntax. Dataview Syntax originates from the popular Dataview plugin for Obsidian. 

This syntax declares a key::value pair that can be used in code. 

For instance:
`session-close::'2025-03-19T04:51:05.362Z'`
is intended to give the ability for the Markdown rendering to display the time the author finished writing that particular draft. 

While YAML is useful, it cannot demarcate multiple start and end points within one Markdown file dynamically. 

There may be more use cases to come.
