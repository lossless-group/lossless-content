image_prompt: "A closeup view of a monitor, a laptop, and a mobile device. The laptop has a text editor, it looks like a markdown editor, a simple version of a document editor.  There is some text there, headers, etc. On the monitor and on the mobile the same text is rendered as a beautiful web page.  There are connecting lines from the laptop to the monitor and the phone"

Why are we still using complex file formats?  [[Vocabulary/AI Models|AI Models]] and [[concepts/Explainers for AI/Code Generators|Code Generators]] all speak [[projects/Emergent-Innovation/Standards/Markdown|Markdown]], [[Tooling/Software Development/Programming Languages/HTML|HTML]], [[Tooling/Software Development/Programming Languages/CSS|CSS]], even [[Vocabulary/Scalable Vector Graphics|Scalable Vector Graphics]]. 

We can use [[Tooling/Software Development/Programming Languages/HTML|HTML]] and [[Tooling/Software Development/Programming Languages/CSS|CSS]] for layout design.  We don't need [[organizations/Adobe|Adobe]] or [[Tooling/Creative/Affinity|Affinity]]. We need to make it a [[Vocabulary/Responsive Design|Responsive Design]] and publish it to the web anyway.  Emails and reports, fine okay. 

Markdown editors are growing like crazy: [[Tooling/Productivity/Advanced Documents/Obsidian|Obsidian]], [[Tooling/Productivity/Advanced Documents/Anytype|Anytype]], [[Tooling/Productivity/Advanced Documents/CraftDocs|CraftDocs]], [[Tooling/Productivity/Advanced Documents/Logseq|Logseq]], 

Open source text editors like [[Tooling/Software Development/Developer Experience/Helix|Helix]], [[Tooling/AI-Toolkit/Generative AI/Code Generators/Zed|Zed]].

Open source version control systems like [[Tooling/Products/Git|Git]], [[Tooling/Software Development/Developer Experience/DevOps/Gitoxide|Gitoxide]], [[Tooling/Software Development/Developer Experience/DevOps/Jujutsu|Jujutsu]].

We have open standards like [[projects/Emergent-Innovation/Standards/WebGL|WebGL]], and [[Vocabulary/WebGPU|WebGPU]], 

We now have a next generation [[Vocabulary/Cross-Platform Applications|Cross-Platform]] framework to build [[Vocabulary/Cross-Platform Applications|Cross-Platform Applications]] with libraries like [[projects/Emergent-Innovation/wgpu|wgpu]].

# Features
Aliases: defaults to plural, singular, acronym, acronym plural. 
Show, hide HTML, CSS
Apps and [[Vocabulary/Plug-ins,  Add-ons,  Extensions|Plug-ins,  Add-ons,  Extensions]]
Use [[Tooling/Software Development/Frameworks/Frontend/UI Frameworks/Tailwind|Tailwind]]

Only deal with [[projects/Emergent-Innovation/Standards/Markdown|Extended Markdown]], 

Embedded [[concepts/Explainers for AI/AI Integrations|AI Integrations]] for both [[concepts/Content Generation|Content Generation]] and [[Vocabulary/Web Development|Web Development]]. 

Build once play anywhere [[Vocabulary/Cross-Platform Applications|Cross-Platform Applications]] with [[Tooling/Software Development/Programming Languages/Rust|Rust]] using [[Tooling/Software Development/Programming Languages/Libraries/wgpu|wgpu]]

### Header syntactial mods for subheaders and subtitles
In markdown there are by default 6 levels of headers.  However, if you want to render a subheader or subtitle you can use syntax to render the remaining text in as a subheading, subtitle, or lede.  For example, 

1. a double pipe (||)
2. a double dash (--)
3. a double colon (::)
4. a double asterisk (**)
5. a double equals (==)
6. a double plus (++)
7. surrounded by parenthesis (Heading (Text))


[[Tooling/Software Development/Developer Experience/DevOps/Jujutsu|Jujutsu]] integration.

Auto path and backlink adjustment on changes in files.

[[uuid]] generation
Split markdown file into two.
