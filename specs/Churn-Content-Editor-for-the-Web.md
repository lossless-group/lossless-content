image_prompt: "A closeup view of a monitor, a laptop, and a mobile device. The laptop has a text editor, it looks like a markdown editor, a simple version of a document editor.  There is some text there, headers, etc. On the monitor and on the mobile the same text is rendered as a beautiful web page.  There are connecting lines from the laptop to the monitor and the phone"

Why are we still using complex formats?  [[Vocabulary/AI Models|AI Models]] and [[concepts/Explainers for AI/Code Generators|Code Generators]] all speak [[emergent-innovation/Standards/Markdown|Markdown]], [[Tooling/Software Development/Programming Languages/HTML|HTML]], [[Tooling/Software Development/Programming Languages/CSS|CSS]], even [[Scalable Vector Graphics]]. 

We can use [[Tooling/Software Development/Programming Languages/HTML|HTML]] and [[Tooling/Software Development/Programming Languages/CSS|CSS]] for layout design.  We don't need [[organizations/Adobe|Adobe]] or [[Tooling/Creative/Affinity|Affinity]]. We need to make it a [[Vocabulary/Responsive Design|Responsive Design]] and publish it to the web anyway. 

Markdown editors are growing like crazy: [[Tooling/Productivity/Obsidian|Obsidian]], [[Tooling/Productivity/Anytype|Anytype]], [[Tooling/Productivity/CraftDocs|CraftDocs]], [[Tooling/Productivity/Logseq|Logseq]].

We have open standards like [[emergent-innovation/Standards/WebGL|WebGL]]. 

We now have a next generation [[Vocabulary/Cross-Platform Applications|Cross-Platform]] framework to build [[Vocabulary/Cross-Platform Applications|Cross-Platform Applications]]

# Features
Aliases: defaults to plural, singular, acronym, acronym plural. 
Show, hide HTML, CSS
Apps and [[Vocabulary/Plug-ins,  Add-ons,  Extensions|Plug-ins,  Add-ons,  Extensions]]
Use [[Tooling/Software Development/Frameworks/Web Frameworks/Tailwind|Tailwind]]

Only deal with [[emergent-innovation/Standards/Markdown|Extended Markdown]], 

Embedded [[concepts/Explainers for AI/AI Integrations|AI Integrations]] for both [[concepts/Content Generation|Content Generation]] and [[Vocabulary/Web Development|Web Development]]. 

Build once play anywhere [[Vocabulary/Cross-Platform Applications|Cross-Platform Applications]] with [[Tooling/Software Development/Programming Languages/Rust|Rust]] using [[Tooling/Software Development/Programming Languages/Libraries/wgpu|wgpu]]
