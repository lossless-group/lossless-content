When innovators or leaders talk about creating an "Ambition Shelter" for innovative employees, they're essentially referring to a supportive environment designed to nurture and protect the ambitious, creative, and often risky work of these employees. Here's what it typically entails:

1. **[[concepts/Psychological Safety]]**: An Ambition Shelter prioritizes psychological safety, ensuring that employees feel secure in taking intellectual risks without fear of negative consequences such as ridicule or punishment for failure. This encourages experimentation and learning from mistakes.

2. **Resource Allocation**: It involves allocating necessary resources—like time, budget, tools, and personnel—to support innovative projects. This includes not just financial resources, but also human capital and access to expertise.

3. **Mentorship and Guidance**: Providing mentors or coaches who can offer strategic guidance, industry insights, and emotional support. These mentors can help navigate challenges and provide a sounding board for ideas.

4. **Protection from Organizational Politics**: An Ambition Shelter aims to insulate innovators from internal bureaucracy or political maneuverings that could derail their projects or diminish their impact. This might involve advocating for them within the organization.

5. **Recognition and Reward**: Recognizing and rewarding ambitious, innovative work appropriately. This can be through formal recognition programs, promotions, or even just public acknowledgment of their efforts and successes.

6. **Space for Failure**: Acceptance that not all innovative ideas will succeed. Instead of punishing failure, an Ambition Shelter views it as a natural part of the innovation process, learning from failures to refine future strategies.

7. **Alignment with Company Vision**: Ensuring that the innovations align with and advance the company's strategic goals and vision. 

In essence, an Ambition Shelter is about creating a safe haven where employees can boldly pursue their ambitions and drive meaningful change within the organization, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and innovation.
