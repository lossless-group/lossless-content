Particularly in light of honorable but ominous regulations surrounding the protection of employees, many endeavors of any business should be overly cautious in rationalizing hiring additional full-time, salaried employees with benefits and legal protections. Not because businesses should have no responsibility to employees, but because there are many initiatives that cannot guarantee the stable increases in revenue that would guarantee the cash flows to support larger and larger headcount. In this light, to ramp hiring of full-time employees with legal protections without the commensurate increases in revenue is, well, long-term irresponsible management.
