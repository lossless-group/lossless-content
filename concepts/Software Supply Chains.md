A software supply chain refers to the network of people, processes, and tools involved in the development, production, distribution, and maintenance of software. It includes various stages such as coding, testing, building, packaging, distributing, and updating software components. 

Just like a traditional supply chain, where raw materials are transformed into products through a series of steps involving different parties, a software supply chain involves the transformation of code into functional software applications. This process often involves multiple contributors, open-source libraries, and third-party tools, all of which can introduce potential vulnerabilities or risks if not properly managed.

The concept gained significant attention in recent years due to high-profile cybersecurity incidents where malicious code was inserted into legitimate software updates, highlighting the importance of securing every step of the software supply chain. This is often referred to as "supply chain compromise" or "[[Software Bill of Materials]] (SBOM) management." It's a critical aspect in maintaining secure and reliable software systems.
