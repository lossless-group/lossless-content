Uses of Symbolic Links:

- **Organization and Access:**
    
    You can create symbolic links to files or directories in different locations, making it easier to access them from a single location. 
    
- **Software Management:**
    
    You can use symbolic links to point to different versions of software or libraries, allowing you to switch between them easily. 
    
- **Backup and Restore:**
    
    Symbolic links can be used to create backups of files or directories, making it easier to restore them in case of data loss. 
    
- **Cross-Drive/File System Access:**
    
    Symbolic links can point to files or directories on different drives or file systems, allowing you to access them transparently. 
    
- **Config Files:**
    
    You can store config files in a central location and symlink them to the places where they are needed.
