**Agents-as-a-Service (AaaS)** refers to a new category of enterprise AI products where **autonomous, AI-powered agents are provisioned on-demand—much like Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)**—to handle complex business tasks and workflows independently, with enterprise-grade security, integration, and transparency.

Agents are not just simple chatbots or rule-based workflows: **they are software systems that perceive their environment, reason, plan, take actions to achieve business goals, and adapt over time**, all with minimal human oversight. [^vc4w61] [^8jzrdk] [^0lz0vm] [^0vud9n] AaaS platforms provide these agents as scalable, managed services for enterprises.
