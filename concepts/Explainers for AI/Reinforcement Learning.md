Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of [[Vocabulary/Machine Learning|Machine Learning]] where an [[Vocabulary/Agentic AI|Agent]] learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to achieve a goal. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, and it uses this feedback to improve its decision-making process over time.

Here's a breakdown of key components:

1. **Agent**: This is the entity that perceives its environment through sensors and acts upon it through actuators. The goal of the agent is to learn a series of actions that maximize some notion of cumulative reward.

2. **Environment**: This is everything the agent interacts with. It could be a simulated world or the real physical world, depending on the application. 

3. **State (S)**: At any given time, the environment can be in one state. The agent perceives this state and acts based on it.

4. **Action (A)**: Based on its current state, the agent selects an action to perform in the environment.

5. **Reward (R)**: After taking an action, the environment transitions to a new state and the agent receives a reward or penalty (positive or negative). The goal of the agent is to learn a policy that maximizes the total reward over time.

The learning process in RL typically involves trial-and-error, with the agent exploring different actions to understand their outcomes and adjust its behavior accordingly. Over time, the agent should learn to perform the optimal action for each state, maximizing the cumulative reward. 

Reinforcement Learning has been successfully applied in various fields such as robotics, gaming, resource management, navigation, and more. It's particularly powerful when dealing with complex, dynamic environments where explicit programming of all possible scenarios is impractical or impossible.
