**Synthetic data** in an AI-Native context refers to data that is artificially generated rather than collected from real-world events. This data is produced using algorithms or simulations to supplement or replace real datasets for use in training, testing, or validating AI and machine learning models . [^1gk7r3] In AI-Native systems, which are designed from the ground up around intelligent, data-driven processes , [^gl39y7] synthetic data becomes a core resource for overcoming traditional data limitations and accelerating innovation.

### What is Synthetic Data?

Synthetic data is **artificially generated information** that mimics the characteristics and statistical properties of real data but does not directly copy actual user information. [^1gk7r3] It is used primarily when real data is scarce, sensitive, costly to obtain, or riddled with legal and ethical restrictions.

Key attributes:
- **Unlimited scale**: Can be produced in any quantity to satisfy data-hungry AI models.
- **Privacy-preserving**: Contains no personally identifiable information, supporting compliance with regulations such as GDPR.
- **Bias control**: Enables developers to curate balanced datasets and intentionally minimize unwanted biases.
- **Customizability**: Facilitates the design of novel or rare scenarios not present in the real world. [^1gk7r3]

### Potential Synthetic Data Providers

Organizations looking to leverage synthetic data can turn to several providers:

- **Mostly AI**
- **Synthesis AI**
- **DataGen**
- **Hazy**
- **[[Tooling/AI-Toolkit/Data Augmenters/Gretel.ai|Gretel.ai]]**
- **Sky Engine AI**

These companies typically offer platforms or APIs for the generation, management, and deployment of synthetic datasets across a range of domains, including vision, text, and structured tabular data.

### Why Organizations Adopt Synthetic Data Approaches

Organizations incorporate synthetic data—and the tools to produce it—for several compelling reasons:

- **Data abundance**: AI models need vast, high-quality, labeled data to perform well. Synthetic data eliminates limitations due to data scarcity. [^1gk7r3]
- **Cost and speed**: Generating synthetic datasets is faster and, over time, less expensive than collecting and cleaning real-world data.
- **Enhanced privacy**: Safeguards sensitive customer and proprietary information, enabling innovation without compromising confidentiality or breaching data protection laws.
- **Bias reduction**: Synthetic datasets can be engineered to be statistically balanced, reducing the propagation of societal biases into AI models. [^1gk7r3]
- **Edge case testing**: Enables simulation and training for unusual, rare, or dangerous situations (e.g., self-driving car near-misses) that are difficult to gather via real-world collection. [^1gk7r3]
- **Leveling the playing field**: Smaller companies or initiatives with limited access to proprietary data can produce competitive AI solutions by leveraging synthetic data. [^1gk7r3]

### What Can Be Done With Synthetic Data?

Synthetic data enables a broad range of AI and analytics applications:

- **Training, validating, and benchmarking AI/ML models** when real data is unavailable, incomplete, or confidential.
- **Simulation and scenario analysis** for product design, safety testing, and what-if experimentation.
- **Bias and fairness audits** enabling controlled studies on how algorithms behave with or without specific features.
- **Personalization and recommendation systems** that rely on privacy-preserving, large-scale simulated datasets.
- **Autonomous systems** (e.g., robotics, vehicles) requiring millions of unique yet realistic inputs for robust performance before real-world deployment.

By accelerating these capabilities, synthetic data is a foundational component of **[[AI-Native]]** solutions—systems where data-centricity, scalability, and continuous adaptation drive innovation from the inside out. [^gl39y7]
