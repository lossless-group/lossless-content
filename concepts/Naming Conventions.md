Linus changed the world simply by creating a taxonomy.  Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish botonist, published Systema Naturae in 1735.  His work went on to include Imperium Naturae, and Genera Plantarum. 

His innovation was almost dead simple.  Through the liberal use of Latin sounding words, paired in [binomial nomenclature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature) 

His work developed into the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]].  It still establishes as a standard, and convention, the way to classify zoological, botanical, bacterial, and viral discoveries and identifications. 

Good technology has solid, clear, documented [[concepts/Naming Conventions]]. 

The Wikipedia page on Linneaus states "the Linnaean system has proven robust and it remains the only extant working classification system at present that enjoys universal scientific acceptance."
