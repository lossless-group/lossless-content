Viral loops, also known as viral marketing or virality, refer to a marketing strategy where existing users of a product or service encourage others to join or use it, thereby amplifying its growth. This concept is often seen in digital platforms and apps.

The term "viral" comes from the way viruses spread – each infected individual can potentially infect many more, leading to exponential growth. In the context of business or technology, this means that a user's engagement with the product leads to invitations to others, who then also engage and invite others, and so on.

A typical viral loop might involve an incentive for users to invite friends (like free credits, discounts, or additional features). The more people join through these referrals, the faster the platform grows. 

For example, social media platforms like Facebook and Dropbox have effectively used viral loops to attract new users. When a current user invites friends to join, those friends not only sign up but also contribute to the network effect, making the service more valuable for everyone involved. 

It's important to note that while creating a viral product can lead to rapid growth, it's not guaranteed and depends on many factors including the product's intrinsic value, the user experience, timing, and marketing efforts.
