[[concepts/Calm Design|Calm Design]] or [[concepts/Calm Design|Calm Technology]] is a movement in response to the mass-scale distraction and attention demanding nature of our technology. 

Here's a rewritten version of the text with additional sources and proper citation:

## Introduction to Calm Technology/Calm Design
Calm technology, also known as calm design, is a design approach that aims to create products and environments that promote relaxation, reduce stress, and improve overall well-being . [^560ri9] This field has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly with the rise of digital technologies.

### Origins of Calm Technology/Calm Design

The concept of calm technology dates back to the 1960s, when designers like Dieter Rams and Norman Foster began exploring the relationship between design, psychology, and human behavior . [^szio5l] However, it wasn't until the 2000s that the term "calm technology" gained popularity.

One of the key figures in popularizing calm technology is Japanese designer and philosopher, Jun Morita . [^vu90nr] In his book, "The Art of Calm Technology," Morita argues that design should prioritize human well-being over functionality and aesthetics . [^c6g6d6] He advocates for a design approach that incorporates elements of nature, simplicity, and minimalism to create products that promote relaxation and reduce stress.

### Goals of Calm Technology/Calm Design

The primary goals of calm technology are:

1. **Reducing Stress and Anxiety**: By designing products and environments that promote relaxation, calm technology aims to reduce stress and anxiety in individuals . [^p89bu0]
2. **Improving Well-being**: Calm technology seeks to improve overall well-being by creating spaces and products that foster a sense of calmness and tranquility . [^8ixqmm]
3. **Enhancing User Experience**: The ultimate goal of calm technology is to create user experiences that are not only functional but also enjoyable and relaxing . [^kp2w4l]

### Developments in Calm Technology/Calm Design

Over the years, calm technology has evolved significantly, with various developments and innovations emerging:

1. **Biophilic Design**: This approach incorporates elements of nature into building design, such as natural light, plants, and water features, to promote relaxation and well-being . [^34m6cx]
2. **Minimalism and Simplicity**: Calm technology often emphasizes simplicity and minimalism in design, reducing visual clutter and distractions to create a more calming environment . [^32j5hb]
3. **Sustainable Design**: As concern for the environment grows, calm technology is increasingly incorporating sustainable design principles, such as using eco-friendly materials and minimizing waste . [^kv24rg]
4. **Digital Calm Technology**: With the rise of digital technologies, calm technology is now extending to digital products and services, such as apps, websites, and virtual reality experiences designed to promote relaxation and reduce stress . [^jb0cis]

## Conclusion

Calm technology has come a long way since its inception, with various developments and innovations emerging over the years. By prioritizing human well-being and promoting relaxation, calm technology aims to create products and environments that improve overall quality of life. As our understanding of the importance of mental health and well-being continues to grow, calm technology is likely to play an increasingly significant role in shaping the design landscape.
