## On the Fiasco of Handoffs
The moments in the [[concepts/Product Development Workflow]] that cause the most pains, create the largest fiascos, are the handoffs. There is simply too much that gets lost in translation. This is generally because the work products and artifacts within any discipline are different.  And, while the work products serve the purpose well of group making it, and everyone claps and follows fully while its being presented -- fast forward a few weeks and when someone from one discipline is staring at an artifact from the previous discipline that made it...  lost in translation.   

For instance:
- Asking Developers to spend a large amount of time pouring over [[User Research]] in the [[concepts/Explainers for Tooling/User Research Repositories|User Research Repository]].
