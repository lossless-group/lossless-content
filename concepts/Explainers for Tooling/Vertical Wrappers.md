# Vertical Wrappers: Creating Value on top of AI Model APIS
***
> [!info] **Perplexity Query** (2025-07-22T14:50:45.005Z)
> **Question:**
> One of the megatrends within AI, startup culture, and venture capital now is the concept or category of a "Vertical Wrapper" around LLMs and other AI Models.
> 
> These "Vertical Wrappers" already include for Copywriting, for Image development, for Video development, and for Legal.  
> 
> Could you cite quality and recent sources as you define and explain Vertical Wrappers, and please give an exhaustive list of available examples.  Please bullet and link to any company and or service/site/web application that is a good example of a vertical wrapper.

A **"Vertical Wrapper"**—often termed a **Vertical AI Agent**—is an AI-based solution designed specifically for the needs and workflows of a single industry (a "vertical"), such as legal, healthcare, copywriting, or financial services. These systems “wrap” a general AI model (like an LLM) with tailored data, workflows, user interfaces, and integrations that encode deep domain knowledge, enabling automation of complex or even end-to-end tasks in a focused area[^scz649][^m3u5fw].

## Key Characteristics

- **Domain Specificity:** Specializes in a single field using industry-specific data and logic, as opposed to "horizontal" AI tools that target common tasks across multiple industries (e.g., generic chatbots).
- **Outcome-Oriented:** Goes beyond offering tools by supporting or even automating outcomes (e.g., generating compliant legal contracts, automating insurance claim flows)[^scz649][^sv1cid][^m3u5fw].
- **Integrated Workflows:** Connects with existing business systems (CRMs, billing platforms, etc.) and workflows, so users can leverage AI without context switching[^scz649][^m3u5fw].

### Differentiation from Generic AI Wrappers

While many early "wrappers" simply provided a user interface for an LLM, vertical wrappers succeed by deeply embedding industry know-how and processes, rather than just providing access to the underlying model[^xsx3qb]. This specialization is necessary to build defensibility and deliver more value than what users can get directly from generalist AI APIs or interfaces[^scz649][^m3u5fw][^xsx3qb].
