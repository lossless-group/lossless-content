The Technology Radar is a concept in business management, particularly within the context of technology strategy and innovation, popularized by ThoughtWorks, a global software consultancy firm. It's essentially a tool used to monitor and evaluate emerging technologies, methodologies, and practices that could potentially impact an organization's operations or strategic goals.

The Technology Radar is typically visualized as a two-dimensional graph with quadrants: 

1. **Adopt**: Technologies in this zone are proven solutions that the organization should consider incorporating into their standard toolkit. They have a clear business value and a mature ecosystem, meaning there's ample support, tools, and community around them.

2. **Trial**: These technologies are promising but require further evaluation. They might not be as mature or proven as those in the 'Adopt' quadrant, but they show potential for significant value to the organization. 

3. **Assess**: Technologies in this category are interesting but have limitations that need to be addressed before serious consideration can be given to their adoption. They might lack maturity, have unclear business value, or present technical challenges.

4. **Hold**: These are technologies that the organization is currently using but should monitor rather than actively adopt. They may still serve a purpose in the short term, but they're not expected to be part of the long-term strategy due to obsolescence, lack of strategic fit, or other reasons.

The Technology Radar encourages an ongoing evaluation process rather than a one-time assessment. It helps organizations stay abreast of technological advancements, make informed decisions about technology investments, and foster a culture of continuous learning and improvement. The specific technologies included in each quadrant can vary widely depending on the industry, the organization's current tech stack, and its strategic objectives.
