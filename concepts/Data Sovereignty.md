When technologists and policymakers advocate for "Data Sovereignty," they're referring to the right of individuals, organizations, or nations to govern their digital data according to their own laws, regulations, and values. This concept encompasses control over how data is collected, stored, processed, shared, and used.

In terms of differences with the status quo (current practices), here are a few key points:

1. **Control and Ownership**: Under current arrangements, large tech companies often have significant control over user data due to their centralized platforms and services. Data Sovereignty shifts this power back towards individuals or nations, giving them more control over their own digital assets.

2. **Data Localization**: The status quo typically involves storing and processing data in the jurisdiction where the tech company is based (often countries with lax privacy laws). Data Sovereignty, on the other hand, often advocates for 'data localization', which means data should be stored within the geographical boundaries of the entity that generates it.

3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Current practices often involve navigating a patchwork of international regulations. With Data Sovereignty, the idea is to have clearer, locally defined rules that entities must adhere to when handling data. This could potentially make compliance simpler and more consistent for organizations operating across borders.

4. **Privacy and Security**: The status quo has often been criticized for prioritizing corporate interests over user privacy and security. Data Sovereignty, especially when implemented by nations, can prioritize these concerns more directly, potentially leading to stronger data protection laws.

5. **Economic Implications**: In the current setup, large tech companies often benefit economically from collecting and using vast amounts of user data. Data Sovereignty could redistribute some of this value by allowing local businesses and nations to leverage their own data, fostering more competitive digital ecosystems.

It's important to note that the implementation of Data Sovereignty can vary widely depending on who is advocating for it (individuals, organizations, or nation-states) and in what context (industry, region, global). It's a complex topic with many facets and potential implications.
