Eric Ries defines **validated learning** as a rigorous process by which entrepreneurs systematically test their assumptions about a business idea through experiments, gather data from real customers, and use that evidence to confirm (or refute) whether their idea is moving them closer to a sustainable business. [^fg8i12] [^kec3zx] [^bn3wyj] This is accomplished through cycles of building a minimal version of a product, measuring customer responses, and learning what aspects create value—forming the famous "Build-Measure-Learn" feedback loop. [^3mcvbg]

**Validated Learning:**
- Is a methodical, evidence-based learning process, not just a theoretical or intuitive insight.
- Requires entrepreneurs to:
  - Identify the *riskiest assumptions* (e.g., "Customers will use our product if it has feature X"). [^kec3zx] [^y4b601]
  - Design experiments (often with a minimum viable product, or MVP) to test those assumptions with real customers. [^3mcvbg]
  - Use measurable metrics to determine if the goal was achieved (e.g., user engagement, conversions). [^fg8i12]
  - Analyze and iterate, making fact-based decisions about whether to pivot or persevere. [^fg8i12] [^3mcvbg]

*Imagine a "Build-Measure-Learn" cycle, where each loop represents an experiment testing a specific business assumption. Results from the 'Measure' phase inform the next 'Build,' demonstrating continuous, incremental learning based on real user data.*

**How is this different from a market insight?**

A **market insight** refers to an observation, intuition, or hypothesis about customer needs, behaviors, or market trends. Market insights are typically based on qualitative research, experience, or analysis. They are valuable as starting points, but by themselves, they haven't been empirically tested or proven correct in your specific context.

| **Process**             | Involves cycles of testing, measurement, and adaptation[^3mcvbg]           | Often based on intuition, research, or experience       |
| **Outcome**             | Generates *proof* of what works/won't work for a business[^bn3wyj]         | Provides ideas, but not validated evidence              |
| **Role in Startup**     | *Guides decision-making* with real-world feedback                    | *Inspires hypotheses* to be tested                      |

*For instance, a team might have a market insight that “busy professionals want healthy meal delivery.” Validated learning would entail launching a simple meal plan MVP, measuring how many professionals sign up, and iteratively refining the offer based on who actually pays and why.*

**Key distinctions:**
- **Validated learning** turns *hypotheses* (including market insights) into *verified knowledge* through experimentation.
- **Market insight** is a starting point; validated learning moves it from theory to evidence-based action.

Validated learning is thus fundamental for startups dealing with uncertainty: it helps prevent investing heavily in untested ideas by ensuring every step is grounded in measurable results, not just assumptions. [^bn3wyj] [^y4b601] [^3mcvbg]
