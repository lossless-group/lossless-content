# The Grantham Foundation: Protecting Our Planet Through Research and Advocacy

## Introduction

The Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment is a private philanthropic organization established in 1997 by Jeremy and Hannelore Grantham to address the most pressing environmental challenges facing humanity. [^g7idko] Founded by Jeremy Grantham, co-founder and Chairman of investment management firm GMO LLC, the Foundation represents a significant commitment of personal wealth and expertise toward environmental conservation and climate action. [^0gpbla] The organization's mission reflects a urgent belief that humanity must act decisively to prevent catastrophic environmental degradation and climate change.

## Main Content

The Foundation's approach to environmental protection operates on two primary pillars: **communication and collaboration** alongside **philanthropy and investment**. [^ppw8yo] Rather than viewing these as separate strategies, the organization recognizes that solving environmental crises requires both raising public awareness and funding innovative solutions. Jeremy Grantham famously stated, "What we are trying to do is buy time…for the world to wake up," capturing the sense of urgency that drives the Foundation's work. [^0gpbla]

The Grantham Foundation distributes grants to journalists, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and scientists to drive advocacy and research initiatives. [^ppw8yo] In 2010, for example, the Foundation provided $2.5 million to the Center for Public Integrity to strengthen investigative environmental reporting over a five-year period. [^0gpbla] The Foundation also supports major conservation organizations, having donated $1 million to both the Sierra Club and Nature Conservancy in 2011, and $2 million to the Environmental Defense Fund. [^0gpbla] These investments recognize that public awareness and political will are essential components of environmental change.

Beyond traditional grant-making, the Foundation has established or co-founded major research institutions focused on climate change and environmental solutions. The Foundation helped establish the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment at Imperial College London in 2007 and the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics in 2008. [^g8vqw5] More recently, it helped initiate the Divecha Centre for Climate Change at the Indian Institute of Science and the Grantham Centre for Sustainable Futures at the University of Sheffield. [^g8vqw5] These institutions generate critical scientific research needed to understand and address environmental degradation.

The Foundation also makes strategic investments in entrepreneurs and firms developing green technologies and sustainable systems. [^ppw8yo] This dual approach—combining philanthropic grants with investment in commercial innovation—reflects recognition that solving climate change requires both immediate advocacy and long-term technological transformation. The Foundation maintains long-standing relationships with organizations including Rare, The Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund, Rocky Mountain Institute, and Environmental Defense Fund to advance novel environmental and climate solutions.

## Current State and Trends

The Foundation operates as a 501(c)(3) private foundation with five trustees from the Grantham family. [^g7idko] Complementing this is The Jeremy and Hannelore Grantham Environmental Trust, a public charity focused on reducing and reversing global environmental degradation, governed by independent trustees who are CEOs of major conservation organizations. [^g7idko] This dual-structure approach enables the Foundation to maintain focused mission alignment while also facilitating broader coalition-building among environmental leaders.

Jeremy Grantham's recognition within the philanthropic and scientific communities underscores the Foundation's credibility and impact. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2015, appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2016, and received the Carnegie Medal for Philanthropy in 2017 alongside his wife, all for leadership in climate change activities. [^g7idko] The Foundation's communications work has achieved tangible results, including grassroots efforts that have successfully stopped coal plant development globally and revealed how fossil fuel companies undermine democratic processes.

## Future Outlook

Looking forward, the Grantham Foundation appears positioned to intensify its efforts as climate science becomes increasingly urgent. With global temperatures projected to rise 2.5°C by 2100 and potentially rendering up to a quarter of the world uninhabitable under current trajectories, the Foundation's message that "the race of our lives" has begun reflects growing recognition of climate urgency. [^j32lyr] The Foundation emphasizes that while technological solutions now exist—including advances in solar power, wind energy, batteries, and electrification—the critical challenge is implementation speed. [^j32lyr] The Foundation will likely continue expanding support for research institutions, investigative journalism, and green technology entrepreneurship to accelerate the transition to a sustainable economy.

## Conclusion

The Grantham Foundation represents a comprehensive model of environmental philanthropy that combines financial investment, scientific research support, public advocacy, and technological innovation. As environmental challenges accelerate, the Foundation's integrated approach to "buying time" for humanity to respond demonstrates how strategic philanthropy can drive systemic change toward a sustainable future.
