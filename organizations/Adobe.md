# **History of Adobe Systems Inc.**

1. **Inception (1982)**: Adobe was founded on October 14, 1982, by John Warnock and Charles Geschke in California. Initially named 'Bookham Technology', the company's name was changed to Adobe (derived from Adobe Creek near their original location) after a year of operation.

2. **Early Beginnings**: The duo started with PostScript, a page description language that allows digital documents to be printed or displayed with high fidelity. This technology revolutionized the printing industry and became one of Adobe's flagship products.

3. **Public Listing (1986)**: Adobe went public in 1986, trading on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol ADBE.

   - **2003**: Launched Adobe Photoshop Elements for consumers.
   - **2005**: Acquired Macromedia, bringing in key products such as Dreamweaver and Flash (later discontinued).

# **Market Share:**

Adobe dominates the professional creative software market with a significant share of its key products:

1. According to Statista, as of 2021, Adobe [[Tooling/Creative/Photoshop|Photoshop]] held around 85% of the market share in image editing software for professionals.
2. In web and UI design, Adobe XD was used by 43% of professional designers globally in 2020 (According to a survey by Stack Overflow).

Additionally, cloud-based solutions and mobile apps are increasingly challenging Adobe's traditional desktop software model.
