Alphabet Inc., formerly known as [[organizations/Google|Google]] LLC, is a multinational conglomerate with diverse subsidiaries and investments. Here are its main business segments, focusing on those that contribute significantly to Alphabet's revenue:

1. **Google Services (Core Business):**

   - **Search & [[Sources/Media/YouTube|YouTube]]:** This includes Google Search, which is the most significant source of revenue for Alphabet. It operates through advertising, where advertisers pay to have their ads displayed next to search results or on YouTube videos that match certain keywords. 

   - **Ads:** Google Ads (formerly AdWords) is another major money-maker. Businesses use it to display ads on the Google search network and partner websites. Google's ad business also includes DoubleClick, an advertising technology company acquired by Google in 2007, which serves ads across various digital platforms.

1. **Google Play:** This is a digital distribution service offering apps, games, movies, music, books, and other content for Android devices. Revenue comes from sales of digital goods (like apps and media) and app purchases within the platform.

2. **[[Tooling/Software Development/Cloud Infrastructure/Google Cloud|Google Cloud]]:** Although not as profitable as Google's core advertising business, Google Cloud provides computing resources, storage, and machine learning services to businesses. It's growing rapidly but currently contributes less to Alphabetâ€™s overall revenue compared to Search & Ads.

3. **Hardware:** This segment includes products like Pixel smartphones, Nest smart home devices (thermostats, security cameras), Google Home speakers with AI assistants, and [[Tooling/Hardware/Chromebooks]]. Sales of these physical goods bring in direct revenue.

4. **Other Bets:** This category comprises a collection of more experimental projects. Some notable ones include:

   - Waymo: An autonomous vehicle technology company. While currently unprofitable, it holds significant potential for future revenue streams once self-driving technology becomes widespread and commercially viable.
   
   - Verily Life Sciences: Focuses on sectors such as healthcare and life sciences. Its projects are still in the early stages of development and not yet profitable.
   
   - Access (formerly Fiber): Google's high-speed internet service, which provides fiber-optic cables to homes and businesses. This is another area with potential for future growth, although it currently operates at a loss due to high setup costs.

6. **Capital & Investments:** This includes venture capital investments made by Google Ventures (GV), part of Alphabet, in various startups around the world. These investments are not directly profit-generating for Alphabet but can yield returns if the invested companies succeed and go public or get acquired.

In summary, while Alphabet has diversified interests across several sectors, its main sources of revenue come from Google Services (primarily Search & YouTube ads) and Google Play. The 'Other Bets' category includes promising yet largely unprofitable ventures that hold potential for future growth.
