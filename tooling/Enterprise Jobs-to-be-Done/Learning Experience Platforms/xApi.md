  xAPI is an eLearning specification that makes it possible to collect data
  about the wide range of experiences a person has within online and offline
  training activities. xAPIâ€™s use of a shared format for both the receiving and
  sending of data makes the specification an ideal tool for sharing learning
  between multiple systems.
