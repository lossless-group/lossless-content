description_site_cp: 'Magentic-One employs a multi-agent architecture where a lead agent, the Orchestrator, directs four other agents to solve tasks. The Orchestrator plans, tracks progress, and re-plans to recover from errors, while directing specialized agents to perform tasks like operating a web browser, navigating local files, or writing and executing Python code.'
