Harvey AI is a **generative artificial intelligence platform specialized for the legal industry** that assists law firms and in-house legal teams with tasks such as legal research, contract analysis, drafting, due diligence, and workflow automation. [^aaux2l] [^k12ara] [^trm60z] [^1p2qc8] Its exceptionally high valuation is due to its focus on deeply integrating advanced AI with domain-specific legal workflows, custom models for clients, and partnership with top-tier investors and legal practitioners.

### What does Harvey AI do?

- **Domain-specific legal AI**: Harvey AI is built on top of large language models (LLMs) from OpenAI, with additional fine-tuning using legal reference materials, case law, and—critically—private firm data such as templates and work products. [^aaux2l] [^k12ara]
- **Automated legal tasks**: Core functionality includes contract analysis, due diligence, litigation support, regulatory compliance checks, research, drafting of documents, and automated intake/population of legal forms. [^aaux2l] [^k12ara] [^1p2qc8]  
  *See ![Relevant diagram or illustration related to the topic](https://www.harvey.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2F07s0r5r6%2Fproduction%2F7f73b08e25dc322155081e65faea8d57cee1f92b-1108x1108.png%3Fauto%3Dformat&w=3840&q=90) for an overview.*
- **Customizable to each firm**: Law firms can further train Harvey with their own proprietary documents, enabling nuanced contextual accuracy similar to onboarding a new team member. [^aaux2l] [^k12ara]
- **Integration and workflow**: Harvey can be embedded into existing legal tech stacks, with support for integration into platforms like Microsoft Azure and advanced workflow automation. [^aaux2l] [^k12ara]
- **Specialization for practice areas**: Offers tailored models for different legal specialties (e.g., corporate, IP, litigation), adapting outputs to local jurisdiction and specific practice needs.

### Why is Harvey winning the Scale-Up?

- **Product-Market Fit in a High-Stakes Vertical**: Legal services involve high-value, high-stakes, and data-intensive workflows. Automating even a small portion delivers immense time and cost savings, which translates to high willingness to pay among top-tier clients. [^8gmm9f] [^aaux2l] [^trm60z] [^1p2qc8]
- **Focus on Security and Customization**: Harvey allows training on highly sensitive, firm-specific data while maintaining data privacy—a critical requirement for legal workflows. [^aaux2l] [^k12ara]
- **Elite Customer Base**: Adoption or piloting by "elite law firms and professional service providers" signals trust and strong defensibility in this vertical, boosting investor confidence. [^1p2qc8]
- **Founders' pedigree and strategic investment**: The founding team combines deep AI research (ex-Google Brain, DeepMind, Meta AI) with practical legal expertise, and the company is backed by OpenAI, Sequoia Capital, and other premier investors. [^8gmm9f] [^trm60z] [^1p2qc8]
- **Early market leadership**: Harvey’s role as an early mover with a specialized, legally aware AI differentiates it from generic LLM solutions, giving it a defensible position as legal adopts AI at scale. [^aaux2l] [^trm60z] [^1p2qc8]

### What kind of Vertical Wrapper did they create?

- **Vertical Wrapper**: Harvey created a "vertical wrapper" by embedding general-purpose LLMs within a domain-specialized environment for law firms. This means:
    - The foundational LLM is tuned with vast amounts of legal data (case law, precedent, regulations).
    - Firms add their own proprietary documents, ensuring contextual outputs that meet firm standards—a process akin to onboarding a new associate’s workflow patterns. [^aaux2l] [^k12ara]  
      *![Additional supporting visual content](https://www.lawnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/harvey-v-harvey.png) could depict this multi-layered model training pipeline.*
    - Harvey provides UIs, workflow automation, security, and integration specifically for the legal sector, rather than generic AI outputs.

### Feature Set

- **Legal Research**: Fast, accurate answers to legal queries based on a synthesis of internal and external legal documents.
- **Contract Analysis**: Automated review, risk identification, and clause extraction/highlighting.
- **Drafting Support**: Creation and revision of contracts, filings, and briefs in firm-adapted language.
- **Due Diligence Automation**: Document review and data extraction for faster, more comprehensive diligence.
