og_description: >-
  MakeHuman is a tool designed to simplify the creation of virtual humans using
  a Graphical User Interface, also commonly referred to as a GUI. This is a
  specialized branch of the more general subject of 3D modelling. The MakeHuman
  Team is focused on this specific branch of the broader subject in order to
  achieve the best possible ease of use in that area. The ultimate goal is to be
  able to quickly produce a wide array of virtual humans with only a few clicks
  of the mouse and be able to render or export them for use in other projects.
