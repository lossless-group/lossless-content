DashVector is a vector search service developed by [[Alibaba Cloud]], based on the Proxima vector engine. The Proxima engine was developed by Tongyi Lab, which is associated with Alibaba's DAMO Academy[1](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/vrs/latest/what-is-vector-retrieval-service)[3](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/retrievers/self_query/dashvector/).Â Therefore, the organization responsible for inventing and maintaining DashVector is Alibaba Cloud, with contributions from Tongyi Lab and DAMO Academy.
