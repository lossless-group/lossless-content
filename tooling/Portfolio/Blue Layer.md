**What BlueLayer Does:**
- Provides a centralized platform for developers to manage all aspects of carbon project operations and inventory.
- Allows seamless, digital interaction between project developers and buyers, reducing reliance on intermediaries and improving response times for RFPs, pricing, inventory updates, and contract management. [^vk0r1t]
- Integrates with partners (notably Sylvera) to offer buyers real-time access to over 200 developers’ project inventories, including live pricing and project updates, along with independent project ratings and monitoring tools for better due diligence. [^1qlrm7]

**How BlueLayer Is Different:**
- Most carbon markets are fragmented, with complex and slow transactions involving many intermediaries. BlueLayer's platform directly **digitizes and streamlines the exchange of carbon project data** (including inventory and pricing), which allows faster, more transparent, and secure transactions between developers and buyers. [^vk0r1t] [^1qlrm7]
- The partnership with Sylvera gives BlueLayer users access to **live data, project ratings, and quality scoring**, further enhancing trust and transparency and facilitating easier investment decisions. [^1qlrm7] [^vk0r1t]
- By simplifying and speeding up data access and due diligence, BlueLayer collectively helps unlock substantial financial flows toward validated carbon projects—over $2 billion in projected investment, with 80+ projects totaling 4 million carbon credits already introduced to buyers. [^1qlrm7]

**Notable Investors and Customers:**
- BlueLayer’s partner **Sylvera** is itself a major, well-funded player in the carbon data space, with over **$96 million raised in funding** and a customer base including global corporations, financial institutions, and governments.
