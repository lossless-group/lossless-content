[[essays/How Docker Changed Everything]]

##### Docker focuses on [[concepts/Getting Started]]
[[Tooling/Software Development/DevOps/Docker]] manages the Docker [[Visual Studio Code|VS Code]] [[Plug-ins,  Add-ons,  Extensions|Extension]], which immediately thrusts the user into [[concepts/Getting Started]] documentation.

#### Docker Hub is an [[concepts/Input Markets|Input Marketplace]]
How [[Tooling/Software Development/DevOps/Docker]] implements [[concepts/Platform Mechanisms]]. Container [[Containers#Container Images|Images]] are a representation of the necessary technologies and code libraries necessary to run a program, a piece of software, or an application. To become more Platform-like, [[Tooling/Software Development/DevOps/Docker]] created an [[concepts/Input Markets|Input Market]], where people can post Images that help others get started  with their software.
