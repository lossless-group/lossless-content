Blacksmith.sh is a **cloud CI (continuous integration) platform** designed to dramatically speed up and optimize **GitHub Actions workflows**, enabling software teams to run their CI/CD pipelines much faster and at a lower cost compared to traditional providers. [^kbhtd9] [^ckzkr9] [^8mk9js]

Blacksmith focuses on providing:
- **Faster CI performance**: It claims to run GitHub Actions jobs up to 2x faster, download caches 4x faster, and build Docker images as much as 40x faster, while also eliminating queue times. [^kbhtd9] [^8mk9js]
- **Cost efficiency**: Teams report saving up to 75% in CI/CD costs, in part due to Blacksmith’s efficient runner infrastructure and straightforward migration process from other CI platforms. [^ckzkr9] [^8mk9js]
- **Easy migration and integration**: Blacksmith is built to work seamlessly with codebases already using GitHub Actions, requiring minimal code changes to switch. [^ckzkr9] [^8mk9js] The platform includes a migration wizard that enables switching in minutes, and offers robust documentation and support. [^12mncc]

**Key Use Cases and Customers**
- Companies use Blacksmith.sh to speed up unit tests, integration tests, and complex workflows that previously took significantly longer on other platforms. [^8mk9js]
- Blacksmith’s fast runners and competitive pricing make it particularly attractive to **AI development teams** and high-growth startups striving to optimize their build and deployment times. [^pr7xus] [^ckzkr9]

**Business Impact**
- Reduced build times translate directly into higher developer productivity and faster shipping of features. [^8mk9js] [^kbhtd9] For example, customer stories highlight CI jobs completing in less than half the previous time, allowing for increased testing and deployment frequency. [^8mk9js]
- Blacksmith supports organizations ranging from individual developers to enterprises, with a scalable offering and detailed documentation for troubleshooting, performance tuning, and security practices. [^12mncc] [^kbhtd9]
