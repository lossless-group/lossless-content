Skip (by Skiplabs) is a different kind of framework compared to Fastify:

### Skip by Skiplabs

- **Type**: Reactive framework for building backend services
- **Purpose**: Focuses on reactive programming and efficient state management
- **Key Features**:
    - Built for reactive computation
    - Automatic dependency tracking
    - Optimized for real-time data updates
    - Developed at Meta for handling complex state management

### [[Tooling/Software Development/Frameworks/Web Frameworks/Fastify|Fastify]]

- **Type**: Web framework for building HTTP servers
- **Purpose**: High-performance web applications and APIs
- **Key Features**:
    - Fast routing
    - Schema-based validation
    - Plugin system
    - Optimized for HTTP request/response cycles

### Key Differences

1. **Abstraction Level**:
    
    - Fastify is a web framework for building HTTP servers
    - Skip is a reactive framework for building backend services with automatic state management
2. **Use Case**:
    
    - Use Fastify for building REST APIs or web applications
    - Use Skip for complex state management and reactive data flows
3. **Maturity**:
    
    - Fastify is a mature, widely-used web framework
    - Skip is newer, originally developed at Meta

For an [[concepts/Explainers for AI/Model Context Protocol|MCP]] server implementation, [[Tooling/Software Development/Frameworks/Web Frameworks/Fastify|Fastify]] is the more appropriate choice as it's specifically designed for building HTTP servers, which aligns with the MCP protocol's needs. Skip would be more suitable if you were building a complex reactive system with real-time state management.
