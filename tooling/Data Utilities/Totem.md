description: >-
  TOTEM explores time series unification through discrete tokens (not
  patches!!). Its simple VQVAE backbone learns a self-supervised, discrete,
  codebook in either a generalist (multiple domains) or specialist (1 domain)
  manner. TOTEMs codebook can then be tested on in domain or zero shot data with
  many ðŸ”¥ time series tasks.
