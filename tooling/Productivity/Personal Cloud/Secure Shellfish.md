# What is Secure Shellfish
"Secure Shellfish" is a [[Tooling/Productivity/MacOS (Operating System)|MacOS (Operating System)]] application designed to provide secure deletion of files and folders, ensuring that they cannot be recovered using standard data recovery tools. It's particularly useful for those who handle sensitive information and need to ensure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands if their device is lost or stipped.

Here's how it works:

1. **Secure Deletion**: Unlike regular deletion, Secure Shellfish overwrites files with random data before deleting them. This process, known as secure deletion or wiping, makes it impossible to recover the original data using common data recovery software.

2. **Multiple Overwrite Passes**: Secure Shellfish supports multiple overwrite passes according to different standards:
   - **Gutman 35-pass** (DOD 5220.22-M): This is a U.S. Department of Defense standard, ensuring the data cannot be reconstructed even with highly advanced forensic tools.
   - **Schneier 7-pass**: Developed by renowned cryptographer Bruce Schneier, this method ensures that even with high-end recovery techniques, the data is effectively erased.

1. **Batch Processing**: Secure Shellfish allows you to select multiple files or folders at once for secure deletion, saving time when dealing with large amounts of data.

2. **Secure Erase of Free Space**: It can also securely erase free space on your hard drive, which could contain remnants of previously deleted files that might be recoverable. This feature helps ensure comprehensive data security.

3. **User Interface**: The app has a simple and intuitive user interface. You can drag and drop files or folders into the application window to initiate the deletion process.

4. **Verification**: After completion, Secure Shellfish provides a verification report confirming that the secure deletion was successful.

5. **No Data Leakage**: It doesn't store any data on your system after use, ensuring there's no risk of data leakage from temporary files or logs.

Remember, while Secure Shellfish offers robust security features, it's not a substitute for regular backups and secure storage practices. Always ensure you have reliable backup solutions in place before performing secure deletion operations.
