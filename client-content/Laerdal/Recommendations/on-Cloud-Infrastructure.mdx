[[concepts/Data Fluidics|Data Fluidics]]

 The rise of [[concepts/Explainers for Tooling/Backend-as-a-Service|Backend-as-a-Service]] platforms significantly reduce the developer time required to build functional prototypes. They can also support most production level applications that will not experience massive, rapid scale (think billions of records per day.)

These almost always include [[REST API|REST APIs]], saving developers the headaches involved in generating [[Boilerplate]] code to enable [[CRUD]] functions. They also offer [[Edge Functions]], and some even provide common infrastructure such as [[User Authentication]].  

To reduce it down, we advise [[Tooling/Software Development/Lego-Kit Engineering Tools/Backend-as-a-Service/SingleStore|SingleStore]].

[[Object Storage]] such as [[Tigris]].

The past few years have seen an explosion in the variety, capability, and suitability of [[concepts/Explainers for Tooling/Databases|Databases]].

Deploying and hosting websites has never been easier, yet has never been more confusing. Let's call some [[concepts/Opsless Deployment Providers|Opsless Deployment Providers]] just a better UI and [[User Experience]] on top of [[Cloud Infrastructure]] like [[Amazon Web Services|AWS]].
