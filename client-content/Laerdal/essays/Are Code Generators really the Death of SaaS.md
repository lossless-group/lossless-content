# AI will kill business critical SaaS
Things like [[concepts/Explainers for Tooling/Enterprise Resource Planning|Enterprise Resource Planning]] and [[Vocabulary/CRM|CRM]] may see sales decline if customers are capable of using AI to build software. 

The concern about code generators, particularly those powered by artificial intelligence (AI), potentially disrupting the Software as a Service (SaaS) market is an interesting topic that warrants exploration from multiple angles.

### Potential Impacts on SaaS:

1. **Democratization of Development:**
   - AI-driven tools can lower the barrier to entry for software development, enabling non-technical users or small businesses to create custom applications without needing a large team of developers.
   - This could lead to more personalized and niche solutions that are tailored specifically to individual business needs.

2. **Customization vs. Standard Solutions:**
   - SaaS providers traditionally offer standardized solutions designed for broad applicability across industries, like CRM or ERP systems.
   - With AI code generators, customers might prefer building custom applications rather than adapting existing ones, potentially reducing the demand for generic SaaS offerings in certain sectors.

3. **Competition and Innovation:**
   - The ability to quickly generate software could spur innovation as businesses experiment with new ideas without significant upfront investment in development.
   - This competition may push traditional SaaS providers to innovate further by enhancing their platforms or integrating AI capabilities themselves.

4. **Focus on Niche Markets and Complex Solutions:**
   - Larger, more complex solutions that require deep industry knowledge might still rely heavily on established SaaS players who can provide scalability, security, and compliance.
   - SaaS companies may need to focus more on vertical markets where bespoke understanding adds significant value beyond what code generators could offer.

5. **Integration of AI Tools:**
   - Some SaaS providers might incorporate AI-driven tools as part of their offerings or integrate with them to enhance the functionality and customization capabilities of their platforms.
   - This integration can help retain customers by offering more flexibility while still providing robust, enterprise-grade solutions.

### Considerations for CRM and ERP:

- **CRM Systems:**
  - These systems often require a deep understanding of customer interactions across various channels. While AI tools could assist in generating basic features or automating certain tasks, the strategic insights provided by traditional CRMs may remain valuable.
  
- **ERP Solutions:**
  - Enterprise Resource Planning involves complex integrations and compliance requirements that might still be challenging for non-experts to handle effectively with generic code generation alone.

### Conclusion:

While AI-powered code generators have the potential to disrupt certain aspects of the SaaS market, particularly in areas where standardization is less critical, they are unlikely to completely replace established SaaS solutions. Instead, they may drive a shift towards more customized and integrated offerings as businesses seek tailored solutions that align closely with their unique requirements.

SaaS providers can adapt by integrating AI capabilities into their platforms or focusing on providing advanced features and services that leverage deep industry expertiseâ€”areas where code generators alone might not suffice.
