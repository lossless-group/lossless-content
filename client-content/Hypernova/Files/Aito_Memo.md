# LP Commitment Memo

## Fund: Aito Capital Fund I

**GP/Firm**: Aito Capital ([website](https://aito.my.canva.site/))  
**Fund Size**: $25M (estimated from portfolio construction)  
**Vintage**: 2024  
**Strategy**: Pre-Seed & Seed stage AI application layer and B2B SaaS  
**Date**: November 16, 2025  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

We committed capital to Aito Capital Fund I, a US-based early-stage venture fund led by **Juan Abundes** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-manuel-abundes/)) targeting the application layer of AI and B2B SaaS companies[^2][^1]. The fund writes $100K-$250K checks into 35-40 portfolio companies at pre-seed and seed stages, targeting 1-5% ownership positions with disciplined entry pricing (average $15M post-money, hard cap at $30M post-money)[^2].

Our investment decision was driven by three core factors: (1) Juan's demonstrated track record deploying $300M+ across 100+ companies with notable early positions in **Deel** ([website](https://www.deel.com)) ($15B valuation, 350x multiple), **Ramp** ([website](https://ramp.com)) ($7.8B valuation, 191x multiple from seed), and **Unit** ([website](https://unit.co)) ($1.2B valuation, 96x multiple)[^2][^1], (2) exceptional portfolio quality signal with 90% of prior investments raising follow-on capital and 8x MOIC across the portfolio[^2][^1], and (3) differentiated sourcing through a network of 500+ operators and relationships with leading institutional investors who view Aito as a downstream signal for their follow-on capital[^1].

The fund's collaborative co-investment strategy positions it as a complementary partner to larger funds rather than competing for lead positions, enabling access to competitive deals through relationship capital[^2]. Early performance indicators from the current portfolio show multiple 2023-2024 vintage investments already achieving 1-3x markups[^2]. The fund provides meaningful operational support focused on customer acquisition and distribution—the primary value-add that Juan leverages to win allocations in competitive rounds[^1].

## 2. GP Background & Track Record

**General Partner(s)**:
- **Juan Abundes** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-manuel-abundes/)) (Founder / Managing Partner): Seven years of venture capital experience beginning February 2017 at **Soma Capital** ([website](https://somacap.com)), followed by role at **BTV** ([website](https://www.btvcapital.com)). Direct investment authority in portfolio companies including **Ramp** ([website](https://ramp.com)), **Deel** ([website](https://www.deel.com)), **Unit** ([website](https://unit.co)), **Yuno** ([website](https://yuno.pw)), and **Tennr** ([website](https://www.tennr.com)). Generated $2B+ in follow-on capital raised from portfolio companies[^1][^2]. Previously established relationships with institutional investors at **A16Z** ([website](https://a16z.com)), **Accel** ([website](https://www.accel.com)), **Lightspeed** ([website](https://lsvp.com)), **YC** ([website](https://www.ycombinator.com)), **NFX** ([website](https://www.nfx.com)), and **Tribe Capital** ([website](https://tribecap.co)) who actively co-invest alongside his deals[^1][^2].

**Firm history**: Aito Capital was founded in 2023 as Juan's independent fund vehicle, leveraging relationships and deal flow developed through prior platforms[^2][^1]. The decision to launch independently was driven by Juan's desire for faster decision-making velocity and direct ownership of GP economics. The firm operates from San Francisco with contact at juan@aito.vc[^2].

**Investment team**: Current structure centers on Juan as sole Managing Partner with investment authority[^2]. The operational model leverages a network of venture partners, founders, and operators for deal sourcing and portfolio support rather than building a traditional investment team -- a detail confirmed by multiple interviews and podcasts[^1][^2].

**Track record highlights**:
- **$300M+ deployed capital** across 100+ companies in prior roles at Soma Capital and BTV[^2][^1]
- **90% of companies raised follow-on capital**—exceptional signal of quality deal selection and founder assessment[^2][^1]
- **8x MOIC** across prior investments, demonstrating consistent returns beyond outlier dependency[^1][^2]
- **$2B+ follow-on capital raised** by portfolio companies, validating market reception of Juan's picks[^2]
- **Multiple 50x+ exits** including Ramp (191x from seed to Series D), Deel (350x), and Unit (96x)[^2]
- **Strong mid-tier performers** with Yuno (16.7x), Tennr (13.3x), and multiple 15-40x markups[^2]
- **Recent vintage momentum** with 2023-2024 investments already showing 1-3x early markups[^2]
