>## Class 5 Global Venture Capital Firm and Strategy

**Class 5 Global** is a San Francisco-based venture capital (VC) firm established in 2018, specializing in early-stage investments across a range of technology sectors and global markets. As a rapidly emerging player, Class 5 Global holds particular significance for startups seeking not just capital, but also strategic guidance and access to a worldwide network of entrepreneurs and investors. [^ud14b0] [^mirt0d] This firm matters because it embodies the increasing globalization of venture capital—actively identifying and supporting high-potential startups far beyond Silicon Valley, thereby shaping the future of innovation ecosystems around the world.

### Main Content

Class 5 Global’s investment strategy is rooted in building long-term partnerships with founders and leveraging deep cross-border experience. The firm positions itself fundamentally as “in the people business,” emphasizing that strong relationships with visionary entrepreneurs are the key drivers of its success. [^3ou0ga] [^wzucd7] Unlike firms focused only on financial returns, Class 5 Global invests heavily in founder support—helping portfolio companies grow with operational guidance, access to expert networks, and introductions to later-stage investors.

Class 5 Global’s typical investment stages include pre-seed, seed, and early growth rounds, generally targeting startups with valuations in the $10–50 million range and an average startup age of three years at the time of investment. [^ud14b0] Their mandate is notably international, with investments spanning North America, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Australia. [^3ou0ga] Frequently, the firm joins syndicated rounds with other globally recognized VCs, such as Thrive Capital, ZhenFund, and Vy Capital, further amplifying portfolio companies' access to resources and follow-on funding. [^ud14b0]

**Practical examples and use cases** of the Class 5 Global strategy include backing transformative companies like:
- **Careem**, the leading Middle Eastern ride-sharing platform, which was acquired by Uber for $3.1 billion and serves over 30 million users across 120 cities.
- **Meliuz**, a cashback service facilitating shopping experiences for over 10 million users in Latin America, which went public in 2020.
- **Fresha**, a merchant platform for beauty and wellness services, supporting more than 80,000 businesses and facilitating over 600 million appointments globally. [^wzucd7]

These cases highlight Class 5 Global’s ability to identify “next-generation global entrepreneurs” and scale local solutions to international relevance.

The **benefits and potential applications** of Class 5 Global’s model include:
- Accelerated international market entry for startup founders.
- Access to seasoned VC partners with diverse global experience.
- Strong syndication networks for capital efficiency and de-risking investments.

However, the approach is not without challenges. Investing across disparate legal, regulatory, and cultural landscapes can lead to complexities in due diligence, portfolio management, and post-investment support. Furthermore, balancing speed of capital deployment with high conviction decisions—a hallmark of competitive early-stage investing—requires robust processes and experienced judgment.
