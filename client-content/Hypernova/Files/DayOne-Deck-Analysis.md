- **Use of Funds**: ["Data center development", "Business expansion", "General working capital to fund ~2GW of capacity", "CAPEX of $10.4B projected from 2025-2030 to build out capacity"]

### Go-to-Market

Long-term partnerships with tier-1 hyperscalers (AWS, Microsoft, Oracle, ByteDance, Morgan Stanley). Collaborates with customers to de-risk market entry. Take-or-pay contracts with pre-commitments during construction phase. Geographic expansion strategy targeting markets outside China with focus on Southeast Asia, Japan, and Europe

### Competitive Landscape

Competes with global data center operators (Equinix, Digital Realty, NEXTDC) and regional players (GDS Holdings, SUNeVision, VNET Group). Key differentiators: 1) Spin-out from top 3 global data center operator, 2) 40% lower cost per MW ($6-8M vs $10-15.7M), 3) 45-60% faster delivery time (10 months vs 18-25 months), 4) First mover advantage in securing land and power in key markets, 5) Proprietary modular design and established supply chain
