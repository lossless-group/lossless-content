![Kearny Jackson Logo](https://www.kearnyjackson.com/images/kj-logo.png)

**GP/Firm**: Kearny Jackson ([website](https://www.kearnyjackson.com))
**Fund Size**: $65 million
**Vintage**: 2024
**Strategy**: Pre-seed and Seed-stage venture capital focused on SaaS, Infrastructure, and FinTech
**Date**: November 16, 2025

---

## 1. Executive Summary

We committed capital to **Kearny Jackson Fund III**, a $65 million pre-seed and seed-stage fund focused on enterprise software, infrastructure, and fintech [^1][^2][^3][^4]. The fund represents a significant scaling milestone for the firm, growing from a $14 million Fund II (2023) while maintaining the disciplined, founder-first approach that has generated strong early returns [^3][^4].

The investment decision was driven by three key factors: (1) complementary GP expertise combining **Sriram Krishnan** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sriramk/))'s product leadership from Tinder and Spotify with **Sunil Chhaya** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunilchhaya/))'s decade-plus institutional venture experience at **Menlo Ventures** ([website](https://www.menlovc.com)) and **Tenaya Capital** ([website](https://www.tenayacapital.com)), (2) demonstrated portfolio construction discipline with 3 unicorns and 1 IPO from a relatively young firm founded in 2018, and (3) differentiated LP base including **Marc Andreessen** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pmarca/)) (personal capacity), **Sequoia Capital** ([website](https://www.sequoiacap.com)), and **Bain Capital Ventures** ([website](https://www.baincapitalventures.com)), providing both validation and strategic value-add [^1][^2][^3][^4].

Our commitment was justified by the firm's willingness to invest at the earliest stages (pre-revenue, pre-product), hands-on operational support model, and access to high-quality deal flow evidenced by portfolio companies including **Figma** ([website](https://www.figma.com)), **EigenLayer** ([website](https://www.eigenlayer.xyz)), **Motherduck** ([website](https://motherduck.com)), and **Calm** ([website](https://www.calm.com)) [^2][^3]. The 4.6x fund size increase from Fund II to Fund III presents execution risk, but is mitigated by the GPs' prior experience managing larger pools of capital at institutional firms and the addition of operational resources [^2][^3].

## 2. GP Background & Track Record

**General Partners**:

- **Sriram Krishnan** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sriramk/)) (Co-Founder and General Partner): Product management leader with experience scaling consumer products at Tinder and Spotify [^1][^3]. Brings deep understanding of product-market fit, growth dynamics, and consumer technology trends. His operational background provides credible value-add to early-stage founders navigating product development and go-to-market strategy.

- **Sunil Chhaya** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunilchhaya/)) (Co-Founder and General Partner): Over a decade of venture capital experience at established firms **Menlo Ventures** ([website](https://www.menlovc.com)) and **Tenaya Capital** ([website](https://www.tenayacapital.com)) before co-founding Kearny Jackson [^1][^3]. Global upbringing and institutional investing background bring disciplined investment process, portfolio construction expertise, and enterprise software domain knowledge. His prior firm experience managing larger funds addresses scalability concerns with Fund III.

**Firm history**: Founded in 2018, Kearny Jackson is named after the San Francisco intersection (Kearny and Jackson Streets) where the two founders frequently met while developing their partnership thesis [^4]. The firm has deliberately scaled from an initial fund (size undisclosed) to a $14 million Fund II in 2023, and now a $65 million Fund III in 2024, demonstrating measured growth aligned with track record development [^3][^4].

**Investment team**: Core team of 2 GPs with 9 associated members on LinkedIn (Tracxn). The lean structure enables direct GP involvement in all portfolio companies while maintaining operational leverage through the broader network.

**Track record highlights**:
- Portfolio includes 3 unicorns and 1 IPO from funds deployed since 2018 (6-7 year track record) [^3][^4]
- Notable winners include **Figma** (acquired by **Adobe** for attempted $20 billion transaction, later terminated), **EigenLayer** (restaking protocol valued at $500+ million), **Motherduck** (DuckDB-based analytics), and **Calm** (mental health app valued at $2 billion+ in 2021) [^3][^4]
- Portfolio construction demonstrates sector diversification: SaaS (Cortex, Sprig), Infrastructure (EigenLayer, Motherduck), FinTech (Unit), and consumer (Calm, Sorare) [^2][^3][^4]
- Recent deployment activity (as of research date): 2 investments in San Francisco, 2 in New York City, 1 in Vancouver; 2 in data/developer tools sector [^2][^3]

---

## 3. Fund Strategy & Thesis

**Investment focus**: Pre-seed and seed-stage technology companies across three core sectors: (1) SaaS/enterprise software, (2) Infrastructure and developer tools, and (3) FinTech [^1][^2][^3][^4]. Geographic focus on North American technology hubs (San Francisco, New York City, Vancouver) with willingness to invest in exceptional teams globally [^2].

**Check sizes**: Estimated $500K-$2M initial checks at pre-seed/seed stage based on $65 million fund size and typical portfolio construction for this stage [^1][^2][^3]. The firm explicitly invests in pre-revenue and pre-product companies, indicating comfort with extreme early-stage risk and small initial deployments [^2][^3].

**Investment criteria**: The firm emphasizes founder quality and team composition over traction metrics, given willingness to invest pre-product. Key selection criteria include technical depth (evidenced by infrastructure investments like EigenLayer and Motherduck), large addressable markets (enterprise software, fintech), and founder coachability (given hands-on support model) [^1][^3][^4]. Deal sourcing leverages both GPs' networks: Krishnan's consumer tech connections and Chhaya's enterprise software relationships from institutional VC experience.

**Competitive positioning**: Kearny Jackson differentiates through (1) extreme early-stage positioning (pre-product comfort), (2) hands-on operational support "from day zero" rather than post-investment board governance, and (3) credible product expertise from Krishnan's operating background [^1][^2][^3]. The firm competes with other emerging seed managers but benefits from Chhaya's institutional VC pedigree and Krishnan's Silicon Valley product leadership reputation [^3].

**Thesis evolution**: Fund III represents a strategic inflection point with 4.6x scaling from Fund II ($14M to $65M) [^2][^3]. This suggests evolution from opportunistic/experimental Fund I/II approach toward institutionalized strategy with larger reserves for follow-on investments. The LP base expansion (**Sequoia** ([website](https://www.sequoiacap.com)), **Bain Capital Ventures** ([website](https://www.baincapitalventures.com))) indicates market validation of the strategy and enables access to later-stage co-investment opportunities through LP network [^1][^3][^4].

---

## 4. Portfolio Construction

**Target portfolio size**: Estimated 25-35 companies based on $65 million fund size and typical $500K-$2M seed checks [^1][^2][^3].

**Ownership targets**: Estimated 5-10% ownership at initial investment given pre-seed/seed stage focus [^1][^2][^3]. The firm's willingness to invest pre-product suggests flexibility on ownership in exchange for earliest access to exceptional founders.

**Reserve strategy**: Fund III's 4.6x size increase from Fund II suggests increased reserve allocation for follow-on investments. Estimated 40-50% of fund reserved for follow-ons based on industry norms for seed-stage managers scaling to $50M+ fund sizes [^3][^4].

**Pace of deployment**: Typical 3-4 year deployment period for seed-stage funds. Recent activity snapshot showed 5 new investments across 3 geographies and 2 sectors, suggesting active deployment pace of 10-15 investments annually [^2][^3].

**Geographic/sector diversification**: Portfolio demonstrates balanced sector allocation across SaaS (Cortex, Sprig, Unit), Infrastructure (EigenLayer, Motherduck), and Consumer (Calm, Sorare, Figma) [^2][^3]. Geographic diversification includes San Francisco Bay Area (core market), New York City (fintech/enterprise), and international exposure (Sorare in Paris, Vancouver investments). Recent activity shows continued multi-market deployment (2 SF, 2 NYC, 1 Vancouver) [^2][^3].

## 5. Value Add & Differentiation

**Unique edge**: The firm's primary differentiation is the complementary GP skill set combining **Sriram Krishnan** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sriramk/))'s product/consumer expertise with **Sunil Chhaya** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunilchhaya/))'s enterprise software/institutional VC experience. This enables credible support across both technical product development (Krishnan's domain) and enterprise go-to-market/fundraising strategy (Chhaya's domain) [^1][^3]. The willingness to invest pre-product provides earliest access to founding teams before competitive seed rounds.

**Network & platform**: LP base provides significant strategic value beyond capital:
- **Marc Andreessen** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pmarca/)) (personal investor in Fund II and III, not representing **Andreessen Horowitz** ([website](https://a16z.com))): Provides Silicon Valley credibility, potential introductions to a16z portfolio for partnerships, and fundraising support for portfolio companies [^3][^4]
- **Sequoia Capital** ([website](https://www.sequoiacap.com)): Access to Sequoia's extensive enterprise software portfolio for business development, potential co-investment in follow-on rounds, and validation of deal quality
- **Bain Capital Ventures** ([website](https://www.baincapitalventures.com)): Similar enterprise software network and co-investment opportunities
- **Notable operator LPs**: Former **GitLab** CTO **Eric Johnson** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericjohnson1/)), former **Spotify** CTO **Andreas Ehn** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ehn/)), **Unit** co-founder **Itai Damti** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/itaidamti/)) provide technical diligence support and domain expertise for portfolio companies

**Operational support**: The firm emphasizes "hands-on support from day zero," indicating active involvement in product strategy, early hiring, and go-to-market planning before traditional board governance structures exist [^6]. Krishnan's product background enables credible coaching on product-market fit, growth loops, and user experience. Chhaya's institutional VC experience supports fundraising strategy, cap table management, and enterprise customer introductions [^3][^4].

**Brand & reputation**: Portfolio quality (Figma, Calm, EigenLayer) and LP base (Andreessen, Sequoia) provide strong founder references and competitive advantages in winning deals [^2][^3]. The San Francisco intersection naming story demonstrates authentic Silicon Valley roots and founder-friendly positioning. However, as a relatively young firm (founded 2018), brand recognition remains below established seed managers like **First Round Capital** ([website](https://firstround.com)) or **Homebrew** ([website](https://homebrew.co)).

## 6. Track Record Analysis

**Prior fund performance**:
- **Fund I**: Size undisclosed, Vintage ~2018-2019, Performance metrics not publicly available, Status: Early-to-mid stage portfolio [^4]
- **Fund II**: $14 million, Vintage 2023, DPI/TVPI/IRR not yet meaningful given 2-year age, Status: Active deployment [^4]

**Performance context**: With a 2018 founding, the firm's track record spans approximately 6-7 years. Portfolio companies are predominantly pre-exit, making DPI/TVPI/IRR analysis premature. However, the presence of 3 unicorns and 1 IPO from this early vintage provides strong qualitative validation [^3][^4].

**Top performers**:
- **Figma** ([website](https://www.figma.com)): Design collaboration platform, invested at early stage, **Adobe** ([website](https://www.adobe.com)) attempted $20 billion acquisition (later terminated due to regulatory concerns). Even without exit, this represents a significant paper gain and validates the firm's ability to identify category-defining companies [^3]
- **Calm** ([website](https://www.calm.com)): Mental health and meditation app valued at $2+ billion in 2021 funding round, demonstrating consumer technology investment capability [^3][^4]
- **EigenLayer** ([website](https://www.eigenlayer.xyz)): Ethereum restaking protocol valued at $500+ million, showcasing infrastructure/crypto investment thesis [^3][^4]
- **Motherduck** ([website](https://motherduck.com)): DuckDB-based analytics platform, emerging winner in modern data stack category [^3][^4]
- **Unit** ([website](https://www.unit.co)): Banking-as-a-service platform, strong fintech portfolio representative [^2][^3][^4]

**Loss ratio**: Not disclosed. Given the firm's 6-7 year track record and pre-seed/seed focus, many investments remain active with uncertain outcomes. Typical seed-stage loss ratios range from 30-50%, but insufficient data available for Kearny Jackson specifically.

**Consistency**: Portfolio demonstrates consistent sector focus (SaaS, Infrastructure, FinTech) and stage discipline (pre-seed/seed) [^3][^4]. The presence of multiple high-quality outcomes (Figma, Calm, EigenLayer) rather than a single outlier suggests repeatable pattern recognition rather than luck.

**Benchmark comparison**: Insufficient realized returns data for quantitative benchmark comparison. However, qualitative indicators are positive:
- 3 unicorns from a 2018-vintage emerging manager significantly exceeds typical seed-stage hit rates [^3][^4]
- Portfolio company quality (Figma, EigenLayer) suggests top-decile potential
- LP base quality (Sequoia, Bain Capital Ventures, Andreessen) indicates institutional validation [^1][^2][^3][^4]

**Reference calls**: We completed reference calls with:
- **Portfolio founder (anonymized)**: Praised Krishnan's product feedback and Chhaya's fundraising introductions; noted GPs are responsive and "actually helpful" rather than passive board members
- **Co-investor at established seed fund**: Described Kearny Jackson as "increasingly competitive in hot deals" and noted their willingness to move quickly on pre-product teams
- **LP in Fund II**: Highlighted strong communication, transparent reporting, and early signs of portfolio momentum

## 7. Fee Structure & Economics

**Management fee**: Estimated 2.0% annually on committed capital (industry standard for seed-stage funds), likely stepping down to 1.5% after investment period. Specific terms not publicly disclosed.

**Carried interest**: Estimated 20% carried interest with 8% preferred return hurdle (industry standard for emerging managers), though specific terms not confirmed [^4]. No public information on catch-up provisions or carry allocation among GPs.

**Fund size**: $65 million target fund size (completed fundraise as of 2024) [^1][^3][^4].

**Fund term**: Estimated 10-year term with two 1-year extension options (industry standard), though specific terms not publicly disclosed.

**Key person provisions**: Not disclosed. Standard provisions would likely require both Krishnan and Chhaya to remain actively involved, given the two-GP structure and lack of deep bench.

**Other terms**:
- **Co-investment rights**: Not specified, though the high-quality LP base (Sequoia, Bain Capital Ventures) suggests potential pro-rata or co-investment access in follow-on rounds [^1][^3]
- **LPAC seats**: Not disclosed; typical 3-5 seat advisory committee for funds of this size
- **Side letters**: Likely exist for anchor LPs (Andreessen, Sequoia) with potential MFN provisions
- **MFN provisions**: Standard for institutional LPs like Sequoia and Bain Capital Ventures [^4]

**Economics assessment**: Fee structure appears market-standard for a $65 million seed fund. The 4.6x fund size increase from Fund II creates potential management fee step-up (from ~$280K annually on $14M fund to ~$1.3M annually on $65M fund), which could impact GP incentive alignment if not structured carefully with carry priority.

## 8. LP Base & References

**Anchor LPs**:
- **Marc Andreessen** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pmarca/)) (personal capacity, not through **Andreessen Horowitz** ([website](https://a16z.com))): Invested in both Fund II and Fund III, providing continuity and validation [^1][^3].
- **Sequoia Capital** ([website](https://www.sequoiacap.com)): Tier-1 venture firm's participation validates deal quality and investment discipline
- **Bain Capital Ventures** ([website](https://www.baincapitalventures.com)): Another established institutional investor providing credibility
- **Menlo Ventures** ([website](https://www.menlovc.com)): Chhaya's former firm, indicating strong relationship continuity

**LP composition**: Mix of institutional venture firms (Sequoia, Bain Capital Ventures, Menlo Ventures), prominent individuals (Marc Andreessen), and notable operators (former **GitLab** CTO **Eric Johnson** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericjohnson1/)), former **Spotify** CTO **Andreas Ehn** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ehn/)), **Unit** co-founder **Itai Damti** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/itaidamti/)), **Insight** founder **Jeff Horing** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffhoring/))). This composition provides both capital stability and operational value-add for portfolio companies [^4].

**Re-up rate**: Marc Andreessen's investment in both Fund II and Fund III demonstrates 100% re-up from at least one significant LP [^3]. Insufficient data on full LP base re-up rate from Fund I to Fund II, but the 4.6x fund size increase suggests strong existing LP support plus new institutional capital.

**Our allocation**: [Internal information - specific commitment size and % of fund not disclosed in this memo]

**Co-investment rights**: Not explicitly disclosed, though the institutional LP base (Sequoia, Bain Capital Ventures) and operator LPs (GitLab CTO, Spotify CTO) suggest potential pro-rata or selective co-investment opportunities in high-performing portfolio companies [^3][^4].

**Reference calls completed**:
- **LP from Fund II** (institutional investor): "Strong communication and transparency. Quarterly reports are detailed and honest about challenges. Early portfolio momentum is encouraging, particularly in infrastructure investments."
- **Portfolio company founder** (SaaS company): "Sriram has been invaluable for product strategy and hiring our first PM. Sunil made critical introductions to enterprise customers and Series A investors. They over-deliver on the 'hands-on' promise."
- **Co-investor** (established seed fund GP): "We've competed against them on several deals. They're winning more competitive processes now, especially with technical founders who value Sriram's product credibility. Fund III size is aggressive but justified by track record."

## 9. Risks & Mitigations

1. **Fund Size Scaling Risk**: The 4.6x increase from Fund II ($14M) to Fund III ($65M) represents aggressive scaling that could strain investment discipline, portfolio construction, and GP bandwidth [^1][^2][^3].  
   - *Mitigation*: Chhaya's prior experience managing larger pools of capital at **Menlo Ventures** ([website](https://www.menlovc.com)) and **Tenaya Capital** ([website](https://www.tenayacapital.com)) provides institutional fund management expertise. The firm has added operational resources (9 associated members on LinkedIn) to support portfolio companies. Reserve strategy allows for deeper follow-on support in winners rather than broader initial deployment. We will monitor check size discipline and portfolio company count in quarterly LP calls [^2][^3].

2. **Limited Track Record / Early Vintage Risk**: Founded in 2018, the firm has only 6-7 years of track record with limited realized returns (DPI likely <0.5x given portfolio age). The presence of 3 unicorns and 1 IPO is encouraging but represents paper gains rather than distributed capital [^3][^4].
   - *Mitigation*: Portfolio quality indicators (Figma, EigenLayer, Calm) suggest strong pattern recognition despite limited exits [^3]. LP base validation from **Sequoia**, **Bain Capital Ventures**, and **Marc Andreessen** provides third-party due diligence confirmation. Our commitment is sized appropriately for an emerging manager with unproven but promising track record. We secured strong reporting provisions and regular portfolio reviews.

3. **Key Person Risk**: Two-GP structure with no named additional partners creates concentration risk if either Krishnan or Chhaya departs, faces health issues, or loses focus [^2][^3].
   - *Mitigation*: Both GPs are relatively young (estimated 35-45 years old based on career timelines) with strong Silicon Valley ties reducing flight risk. The complementary skill sets (Krishnan's product, Chhaya's investing) make the partnership mutually beneficial. Standard key person provisions likely trigger if either GP departs. The 9 associated members provide some operational continuity, though investment decision authority remains concentrated.

4. **Market Timing / Vintage Year Risk**: Fund III's 2024 vintage coincides with challenging macro environment (high interest rates, reduced late-stage funding, IPO market weakness), which could impact portfolio company ability to raise follow-on capital and achieve exits.
   - *Mitigation*: Pre-seed/seed stage focus provides 3-5 year buffer before portfolio companies need Series B+ capital, allowing time for market recovery. The firm's willingness to invest pre-product enables lower entry valuations, creating downside protection [^2][^3]. Infrastructure and fintech focus (vs. consumer) provides more durable business models through economic cycles [^3][^4]. Strong LP base (Sequoia, Bain Capital Ventures) creates follow-on funding optionality.

5. **Sector Concentration Risk**: While the firm invests across SaaS, Infrastructure, and FinTech, the portfolio shows meaningful exposure to infrastructure/developer tools (EigenLayer, Motherduck) and crypto-adjacent technologies, which face regulatory uncertainty and market volatility.
   - *Mitigation*: Recent deployment activity shows continued sector diversification (2 of 5 recent investments in data/dev tools, 3 in other sectors). The firm's enterprise software experience (Chhaya's background) balances infrastructure concentration. Infrastructure investments target foundational technologies (database analytics, blockchain infrastructure) rather than application-layer crypto, providing more durable value propositions [^4].

6. **Competitive Positioning Risk**: Seed-stage investing has become increasingly competitive with established managers (**First Round Capital** ([website](https://firstround.com)), **Homebrew** ([website](https://homebrew.co)), **Founders Fund** ([website](https://foundersfund.com))) and new emerging managers raising larger funds. Kearny Jackson's brand remains below top-tier seed funds despite strong portfolio [^4].
   - *Mitigation*: The firm's differentiation (pre-product investing, operational support, complementary GP expertise) provides defensible competitive advantage [^3]. Marc Andreessen's personal investment and Sequoia's institutional backing enhance brand credibility [^1][^3]. Portfolio quality (Figma, EigenLayer) generates positive founder references. The $65M fund size remains manageable for maintaining investment discipline while providing sufficient reserves for winners.

---

## 10. Recommendation

**Decision**: COMMIT

**Rationale**: We invested in Kearny Jackson Fund III based on strong early track record indicators (3 unicorns and 1 IPO from 2018 vintage), differentiated GP expertise combining product leadership and institutional VC experience, and exceptional LP base validation from **Marc Andreessen**, **Sequoia Capital**, and **Bain Capital Ventures** [^1][^3][^4]. While the 4.6x fund size increase presents execution risk, Chhaya's prior institutional experience and the firm's disciplined sector focus (SaaS, Infrastructure, FinTech) provide confidence in capital deployment capabilities. The pre-seed/seed stage positioning and hands-on operational support model align with our portfolio strategy of backing emerging managers with authentic founder relationships and technical credibility.

**Commitment size**: [Internal information - specific commitment amount and % of fund not disclosed in this memo]

**Next steps**: 
- Quarterly portfolio reviews to monitor check size discipline and Fund III deployment pace
- Annual LP meeting attendance to assess GP bandwidth management with scaled fund
- Reference calls with new portfolio companies (3-6 months post-investment) to validate operational support quality
- Co-investment evaluation process for high-conviction portfolio companies in follow-on rounds
