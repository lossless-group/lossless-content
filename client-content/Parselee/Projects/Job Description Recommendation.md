# Something isn't adding up
1. Why would Matt and Nicholas be fine with people I haven't even met, have not been introduced to do, and will not work with for at least six to 8 months make the call to let me go?
	1. Did I disappoint Nick more than once?  
	2. Did I disappoint Matt (he never said). 
# A few Points to an Appeal

## Of course you have every right to choose to part ways with me.  
1. I get letting people go early, though I've only done it with procedures. 
2. Of course startups are at-will 
3. Of course startups need to be sensitive to the dynamics between team members, and any egregious behavior should not be tolerated. 
4. My appeal 


## I'm worth another shot, I'm motivated by the Coglet concept, and ready to execute on overdrive:

### I can adapt and develop with no management overhead.
1. I developed different habits and ways of communicating that I knew might be a misfit to a high-execution corporate environment, and I asked for your patience in me learning to adapt.  
	1. Of course we needed to learn how to work with each other and communicate well.  I am very willing to adapt and I do, this applies to communication style. For example:  
		1. Nick asked me to not go silent over the weekend and then I didn't. 
		2. He asked me to be on time for meetings and I did. 
		3. Matt set aggressive timelines and I met them, three weeks in a row.  
		4. Mat asked us to "dogfood" on Microsoft Teams and I was immediately the most active person in Teams. 
	2. You should only have to ask me once (with maybe a little grace.) 
	3. I might have learned to communicate vacillating between over-confidence and self-effacing jokes, but I never brought that to every situation.  I always tried to be contextual, though I do have a slight "asbergers" that can lead me to not "read the room" the first time.  Even when I don't, when someone communicates with me for an extended period is usually very positive. 
2. The vast majority of people that have worked with me would actually say that I'm very empathetic, that I care deeply about my colleagues, that I work together well with most anyone. You can look at my LinkedIn Recommendations, I can give you references.  

### I am very capable, and very capable at things needed now AND later by the Parslee/Coglet team. 
1. I do know how to do more than full-stack.  I'm a very versatile commando, and I'm a quick study that loves diving into new challenges.  
	1. The "Marketing Setup Commando" is actually a super valuable role and the way I think about it is rare and state-of-the-art. Having a startup commando that can handle 
		1. full-stack marketing, 
		2. developer community, 
		3. vibe code decent application code not just website code, 
		4. and meaningfully contribute to capital raises as either a FT team member or a future consultant is also rare. 
	2. To cast all that out because I had a clumsy set of communications with people I was not introduced to, had no context on. For instance, I would not have been attempting to make jokes with Nicole if I knew she was 
2. The Coglet brand and messaging shift got me very excited, like ALL-IN excited.  
### I have an overdrive, and unfortunately I didn't hit it my first few weeks through known circumstances. 
My work ethic the past two weeks has not been peak.  I've had to deal with some personal issues and volatility (travel, setup, interpersonal obligations), and Nick was aware that I had a few loose ends on a previous project (That has a lot of overlap and value spillover with Parslee and my work for Parslee). Both Matt and Nick were aware that I was to stay in Europe until after the Kauffman Summit with the VCs to get feedback, then head back to Texas and be stable, go into over-drive.  If I made a bad impression on work ethic or output, we both knew I was in Europe bouncing around a bit, winding up previous work, and there would be a transition.  

## It was a strange situation that wasn't proactively managed by either side, and it's not representative of who I am or how I behave towards my colleagues. 
1. I really didn't know who Mike is, only that I should ask him for an Expense card. My communications with him were probably terse and me just trying to get the card and understand how to use it.  I assumed Mike is staying with Volato and that reverse merger, he was not introduced as a FT key executive for Parslee.  I was trying to minimize taking his time. 
2. The legacy Volato expense policies and classifications/tags/categories/accounts system was bewildering to me because I had no idea how to navigate it. 
3. One of my first transactions was getting classified as "gambling" and rejected even though it's a site and section templating engine that would help build out section components quickly.  I was trying to troubleshoot that, maybe wasn't very polite about it?
4. Same with Nicole, my assumption is she was a part time admin, maybe someone in HR that handles procedural issues.  I didn't find out until I made some attempts to be "cute" to that kind of persona that she was a key executive, an attorney, a long-time collaborator, and likely going to be part of Parslee.  
5. Neither of them clarified they are joining Parslee or what their role is.  I literally was assuming I should minimize demands on their time.  I only made small-talk with Nicole to try to use the conversation as a way to get-to-know each other.  I was trying to build rapport, and I didn't read the room correctly.
6. My work habits and nomadic choices actually genuinely do cause comedic clashes with systems, and the best way for me to cope has been to be self-effacing and make fun of the absurdity.  
	1. I want to be on health insurance.  What is my address. I have a family home in Austin, and a shared apartment in San Francisco.  Do I want to be in Austin, TX or San Francisco, CA?  I probably want to be in Austin for a few months and then San Francisco.  Would that be possible?  
	2. She's going to email me the paperwork.  I say I'm not in the habit of checking Parslee email yet, could she text me to tell me she .  It's been a long time since I had an "on top of email" demand.  

##  The "professional" thing to do when there is a cultural clash is to proactively communicate, provide clarity, and engage in a process to improve the situation.
1. To some degree, I feel like the unstated and slightly stated message is that I wasn't proving to be a cultural fit and wasn't meeting standards of professionalism.  
2. But the professional way to handle that is to communicate clearly.  Not pull the rug out from someone.  

## This affects me a great deal, and makes my frustrating situation much more precarious. 
1. I took this gig for:
	1. To have the opportunity to work with Nicholas, who I have known and trusted for a long time.
	2. To apply skills I have developed recently and perform them at the level of mastery I believe I can. 
	3. To use a salary and benefits to stabilize and execute.  
	4. I put some ducks in a row to return to Texas, make sure my health is in order with new health insurance, return to cash savings.  This was a good arrangement for me, and over the course of two months I was "betting on this."  So, I put in two months of expectation and was given 0 additional chances.  It's kind of unfair treatment, and I doubt it's who anyone on the Volato or Parslee team "wants to be." 

## If rebooting FT/cofounder potential is not viable, there is Contract Work that will be of exponential value to Parslee, and work for me.
1. No need to figure out cofounder situation
