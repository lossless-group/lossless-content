Having been in operation for over 70 years, Laerdal has lots of data. But its also in lots of conditions.

AI can significantly enhance the dissemination and utilization of internal knowledge within an international corporation in several ways:

1. **Intelligent Search**: Advanced search algorithms can help employees find relevant information quickly, even across multiple platforms or languages. AI can understand context through [[Vocabulary/Retrieval-Augmented Generation|Retrieval-Augmented Generation]] and [[Vocabulary/Knowledge Augmented Generation|Knowledge Augmented Generation]]  to provide more accurate results.

2. **[[concepts/Explainers for Tooling/Knowledge Management|Knowledge Management]] Systems (KMS)**: These systems use AI for categorizing, indexing, storing, and retrieving knowledge assets. They can automatically tag content with metadata, making it easier to find and understand.

3. **Chatbots & [[concepts/Explainers for AI/AI Assistants|Virtual Assistants]]**: AI-powered chatbots can act as internal helpdesks or guides, providing instant answers to employee queries, reducing the burden on HR and subject matter experts.

4. **[[concepts/Explainers for Tooling/Predictive Analytics]]**: By analyzing patterns in data, AI can predict what information an employee might need next, proactively suggesting relevant resources.

5. **Language Translation Tools**: For international companies, real-time translation tools powered by AI can break down language barriers, enabling seamless knowledge sharing across different countries and languages.

6. **[[concepts/Explainers for Tooling/Learning Experience Platforms|Learning Experience Platforms]]**: AI can personalize learning experiences based on an employee's role, skills, and progress, ensuring everyone has access to the right training materials. These platforms use AI to suggest relevant content or connections based on an individual’s role, interests, and expertise, fostering a culture of continuous learning.

7. **Document Summarization**: Tools that can summarize lengthy documents into key points can save employees time and ensure they grasp the main ideas quickly.

Some tools currently available include:

- **IBM Watson Knowledge Catalog**: A comprehensive solution for discovering, understanding, and using trusted data sources across an organization.
  
- **Microsoft Learning Tools**: Offers Immersive Reader, which includes features like text spacing adjustment, parts of speech highlighting, and more to aid in learning. 

- **Workplace by Facebook (now called Meta Workplace)**: Integrates AI for features like trending topics, suggested posts based on interests, and even a virtual assistant named 'Work Chat Bot'.

- **SAP SuccessFactors Learning**: Uses AI for personalized learning recommendations and predictive analytics.

- **[[Clarice]]**: An AI-powered knowledge management platform that uses natural language processing to understand documents and make them searchable.

- **[[Yamedi]]**: A social learning platform that leverages AI for content recommendation, skill assessment, and more.

Remember, the effectiveness of these tools depends on how well they're integrated into existing workflows, and how actively employees engage with them.
