Having been in operation for over 70 years, Laerdal has lots of data. But its also in lots of conditions.  

[[Vocabulary/Knowledge Bases|Knowledge Bases]]

AI can significantly enhance the dissemination and utilization of internal knowledge within an international corporation in several ways:

1. **Intelligent Search**: Advanced search algorithms can help employees find relevant information quickly, even across multiple platforms or languages. AI can understand context through [[Vocabulary/Retrieval-Augmented Generation|Retrieval-Augmented Generation]] and [[Vocabulary/Knowledge Augmented Generation|Knowledge Augmented Generation]]  to provide more accurate results.

2. **[[concepts/Explainers for Tooling/Knowledge Management|Knowledge Management]] Systems (KMS)**: These systems use AI for categorizing, indexing, storing, and retrieving knowledge assets. They can automatically tag content with metadata, making it easier to find and understand.

3. **Chatbots & [[concepts/Explainers for AI/AI Assistants|Virtual Assistants]]**: AI-powered chatbots can act as internal helpdesks or guides, providing instant answers to employee queries, reducing the burden on HR and subject matter experts.

4. **[[concepts/Explainers for Tooling/Predictive Analytics|Predictive Analytics]]**: By analyzing patterns in data, AI can predict what information an employee might need next, proactively suggesting relevant resources.

5. **Language Translation Tools**: For international companies, real-time translation tools powered by AI can break down language barriers, enabling seamless knowledge sharing across different countries and languages.

6. **[[concepts/Explainers for Tooling/Learning Experience Platforms|Learning Experience Platforms]]**: AI can personalize learning experiences based on an employee's role, skills, and progress, ensuring everyone has access to the right training materials. These platforms use AI to suggest relevant content or connections based on an individual’s role, interests, and expertise, fostering a culture of continuous learning.

7. **Document Summarization**: Tools that can summarize lengthy documents into key points can save employees time and ensure they grasp the main ideas quickly.

Some tools currently available include:

- **[[Tooling/AI-Toolkit/Models/IBM Watson|IBM Watson]] Knowledge Catalog**: A comprehensive solution for discovering, understanding, and using trusted data sources across an organization.
  
- **Microsoft Learning Tools**: Offers Immersive Reader, which includes features like text spacing adjustment, parts of speech highlighting, and more to aid in learning. 

- **Workplace by Facebook (now called Meta Workplace)**: Integrates AI for features like trending topics, suggested posts based on interests, and even a virtual assistant named 'Work Chat Bot'.

- **SAP SuccessFactors Learning**: Uses AI for personalized learning recommendations and predictive analytics.

- **[[Clarice]]**: An AI-powered knowledge management platform that uses natural language processing to understand documents and make them searchable.

- **[[Yamedi]]**: A social learning platform that leverages AI for content recommendation, skill assessment, and more.

Remember, the effectiveness of these tools depends on how well they're integrated into existing workflows, and how actively employees engage with them.

Companies are using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques** together with **Knowledge Bases or Knowledge Hubs** to significantly amplify knowledge dissemination by enabling contextual, real-time, and highly efficient information access across the organization. [^5vm02i] [^10hfef] [^l30o0w] RAG-enhanced systems combine the retrieval of highly relevant data from enterprise sources with the generative power of large language models (LLMs), ensuring employees access not only accurate but also contextually synthesized answers to complex queries[^5vm02i] [^4gp408] [^l30o0w]![Relevant diagram or illustration related to the topic](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc27474a/67ab4219bea97e1dd6f543a2_2llm_evals_2.png).

**How Companies Are Applying RAG and Knowledge Hubs:**

- **Rapid Document Retrieval:** RAG systems can instantly pull relevant information from internal wikis, documents, archived reports, and other sources. [^5vm02i] [^10hfef] [^l30o0w]
- **Automatic Summarization:** They generate concise summaries of lengthy documents, facilitating quick consumption of key insights without manual review. [^5vm02i] [^10hfef]
- **Improved Productivity:** By automating information search and synthesis, employees spend less time hunting for data, increasing operational efficiency. [^5vm02i] [^4gp408] [^10hfef]
- **Enhanced Collaboration:** These systems democratize access to organizational knowledge, ensuring up-to-date, consistent information and breaking down silos between teams[^5vm02i] [^4gp408]![Practical example or use case visualization](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65a11a72834cb899bc54a7d6/684804c1b64bcb0b763303b4_how%20rag%20works.webp).

**Real-World Company Examples:**

- **Bell (Telecommunications):** Deployed a RAG-powered knowledge hub, enabling fast access to up-to-date policies. Advanced document embedding pipelines and automated updates ensure their knowledge base remains current and reliable. Bell reports streamlined updates and more consistent knowledge access across employees. [^4gp408]
- **Royal Bank of Canada (RBC):** Uses the "Arcane" RAG system to help specialists quickly locate complex and proprietary policy information. This speeds up responses and simplifies training of new staff. [^4gp408]
- **[[organizations/Harvard Business School|Harvard Business School]]:** Integrated a RAG chatbot [[Conversational RAG]] into academic channels that allows students to ask questions about complex topics, using a corpus of course content and chat histories. This directly improves student comprehension and course engagement[^4gp408]![Additional supporting visual content](https://daxg39y63pxwu.cloudfront.net/images/blog/advanced-rag-techniques/Advanced_RAG_Techniques.png)
>Visualization of LinkedIn’s customer support pipeline before and after RAG adoption, highlighting reduction in resolution time and improvements in both customer and employee satisfaction.

- **LinkedIn (Customer Support):** Implemented RAG for customer service queries, resulting in a **28.6% reduction in median per-issue resolution time**—demonstrating the technology’s measurable impact on efficiency and service quality. [^4gp408]

**Impact Data & Research Findings:**

- **Resolution Time Improvement:** LinkedIn’s data shows nearly a 30% decrease in issue resolution time after adopting RAG-enhanced knowledge systems. [^4gp408]
- **Consistent Knowledge Distribution:** Companies like Bell and RBC found that RAG-enabled hubs ensure that employees receive the *latest available information*, reducing inconsistencies created by manual updates. [^4gp408]
- **Time-to-Insight Reduction:** Legal and financial institutions report searching and summarizing thousands of pages in seconds using RAG, compared to manual processes that previously took hours or days. [^10hfef]
- **Employee Productivity:** Organizations have observed broad improvements in employee workflows, claiming significantly less time spent searching for information and dramatically improved collaboration. [^5vm02i] [^l30o0w]

**Why RAG and AI Knowledge Hubs Succeed:**

- **Overcome Traditional Limitations:** RAG systems resolve access bottlenecks inherent in legacy knowledge management (KM) platforms by integrating real-time semantic search and contextual generative capabilities. [^10hfef] [^l30o0w]
- **Personalized, Contextual Responses:** Employees receive relevant information tailored to their specific queries, improving usability and satisfaction. [^l30o0w]
- **Scalability:** Systems like Bell’s modular pipeline model allow organizations to efficiently update and scale their knowledge bases as information grows or changes. [^4gp408] [^3apau0]
