For large scale businesses, [[concepts/Explainers for AI/Artificial Intelligence|AI]] represents an enormous, amorphous, and head-scratching opportunity.

There is definite value in just getting started. Anyone can throw PDFs, word documents, presentations, and spreadsheets into a folder and suddenly have some serious magical powers. 

But for the whole organization to benefit, [[concepts/Explainers for AI/Knowledge Base AI]], using [[Vocabulary/Retrieval-Augmented Generation]] and [[Knowledge Augmented Generation|KAG]] approaches and tools, requires preparing data with an intention and clarity, a discipline and rigor, that most organizations have never bothered with.  

While much of the tactical work can be left to professionals in [[Data & Analytics]], there is actual enabling work that can only be done by [[Executive Management]]. 

One of the most crucial enabling [[concepts/CARBS|CARBS]] is to codify [[concepts/Naming Conventions|Naming Conventions]].
