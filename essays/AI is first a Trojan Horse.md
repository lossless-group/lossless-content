# Business leaders will be eager at first, then shocked to the core. 

Pretty much every business that wants a competitive edge is already knee deep trying to figure out how to best use AI. 

There is something seductive about imaginging and experiencing even basic LLM capability. It feels super human, at first. It conjures science fiction. We were promised jetpacks, dammit.

> We were promised jetpacks, dammit.

Add the Fear of Missing Out, but in business boardroom bingo. To not adapt is to foresee an existential threat. 

Both of these motives are true, truer than even the most motivated of us can fathom. 

Yet, adopting AI is inviting in a Trojan Horse. Maybe that metaphore is a bit belltristic. Perhaps it's more like Meet the Faulkners. 

Imagine being excited for your birthday. Your friends blindfold you and say they have a surprise for you. When you arrive, it is a family reunion followed by a high school reunion. Your new emotional reality is that all the awkward business you were avoiding, or swept under the rug, will now be in full display.

For the most part, by mid-2025, we observe the following:

- almost everyone is using LLM's to generate content so they can send more email faster. 
- Many are using it to make presentations with more content and better looking without as much pixel pushing.
- Students are using it to write papers, even fill out their homework. 
- Designers are using it to generate many concepts.
- Software engineers are using it to generate boilerplate code. 
- Data analysts are using it to sort through a bunch of data, filter out the irrelevant, and come back with the relevant data that needs focus.

What do all the popular use cases of AI have in common?  

Well, they are individuals motivated to better leverage their time and brainpower by delegating the more mundane parts of their job to AI. 

As it should be.  The 'Economy of Action' is one of the more predictable behavioral patterns of, not just humans, but all lifeforms. 




First, we will need to think about databases in a way we have not. 
We might have to consider [[Vocabulary/Vector Databases|Vector Databases]]
