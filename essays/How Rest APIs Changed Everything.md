## Perplexity Query 
<<2025-07-19T18:43:56.172Z
**Question:** How have REST APIs and the REST standard changed the world?  Please include a history, and give some statistics as of 2025, citing quality sources of course.
**Model:** sonar-pro

### **Response from sonar-pro**:

REST APIs—short for **Representational State Transfer** APIs—have fundamentally reshaped how the modern web, apps, and digital platforms are built, integrated, and scaled.

**History of REST APIs:**
- *Pre-REST Era*: Before REST, most API integrations used SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), which was complex, required XML, and was difficult to debug and scale[1][3].
- *2000: REST Introduced*: Roy Fielding outlined REST in his doctoral dissertation, introducing a stateless, resource-oriented architecture that used standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to operate on data. REST emphasized simplicity, scalability, and easy web infrastructure compatibility[1][3].
- *Early 2000s Adoption*: eBay launched one of the first major REST APIs in 2002, quickly followed by Amazon. This allowed external sites to connect seamlessly, fueling e-commerce expansion. Flickr’s 2004 API made rich web integrations easy, and platforms like Facebook and Twitter moved to RESTful patterns by 2006 to meet demand and reduce unofficial “Frankenstein” APIs cobbled together by web scrapers[1].
- *2010s to Present*: REST APIs have become the default standard, widely embraced across the tech industry. Tools like Postman have further simplified their design, testing, and deployment, making API-first development a baseline expectation[1].

**Global Impact of REST APIs:**
- REST APIs have driven the **interoperability** and **integration** of web services, enabling disparate systems to communicate reliably and efficiently. This underpins everything from single sign-on systems to payment gateways to social media sharing widgets[2].
- Their **predictable behavior**, *uniform interface*, and *standards-based approach* reduce the learning curve for developers and allow for smoother future integrations and migrations as technologies evolve[2][3][4].
- RESTful patterns have *enabled the explosion of SaaS (Software as a Service)*, cloud computing, mobile app ecosystems, and the API economy, empowering businesses to rapidly extend their platforms and reach new users[1][5].

**Key Statistics and Industry Scope (as of 2025):**
- Over **90% of public APIs** use the REST architectural style; REST continues to dominate, despite the rise of alternatives like GraphQL and gRPC[1][4].
- The **API economy** is projected to exceed **$7.2 trillion** in annual global economic impact by 2025, with RESTful APIs at its core (industry estimates)[1].
- The average enterprise manages **over 200 APIs**, and leading tech firms manage and expose thousands of REST endpoints[2].
- Postman, a leading API development platform, reported over **30 million users** and **100 million APIs** (most of them REST-based) in its global workspace by 2024[1].
- REST APIs are integral to industries like finance (open banking APIs), healthcare (FHIR standards), e-commerce, IoT, and more[4].

**Primary Reasons for REST’s Enduring Utility:**
- **Simplicity**: Utilizes common web protocols, making it easy to build, use, and debug[4].
- **Scalability**: Stateless interactions support massive scaling and parallel processing[4].
- **Flexibility**: Supports a variety of data formats (JSON, XML, plain text)[4].
- **Security**: Integrates with modern authentication and encryption methods[4].
- **Platform Independence**: Works across languages, devices, and environments, fostering ubiquitous connectivity[4].

**Summary Table: Evolution and Influence of REST APIs**

| Era               | Milestone                         | Impact                                         |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Pre-2000s         | SOAP, XML-RPC                     | Complex, rigid, hard to scale                  |
| 2000              | REST defined by Roy Fielding       | Simple, scalable, HTTP-based standardization   |
| Early 2000s       | eBay, Amazon, Flickr REST APIs    | First mainstream adoption and mass connectivity|
| 2006–2015         | Social, mobile, SaaS boom         | API-first architectures, cloud, mobile growth  |
| 2015–2025         | REST dominates, alternatives grow | API economy, microservices, global integration |

By providing a **shared language and standard for digital communication**, REST APIs have become the universal backbone of web services and are a cornerstone of modern business, commerce, and innovation[1][2][3][4].
