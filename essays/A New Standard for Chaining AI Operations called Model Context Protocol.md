Anthropic launched the Model Context Protocol on November 25, 2024, [^8cac05] it was a game-changer for AI use and code generation. It allowed for the chaining of AI operations, which made it possible to create complex workflows that could be used to generate code, documents, and other content.

## What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard developed to enable secure, two-way integration between AI-powered applications (such as large language models and agents) and external data sources, tools, and services. Its primary goal is to standardize how AI systems access, retrieve, and act on real-world data, replacing the fragmented, custom integrations that previously dominated the ecosystem. [^8cac05] [^b51563] [^b479a8] [^081ad2]

MCP draws inspiration from the Language Server Protocol (LSP), which unified how code editors interact with programming languages. Similarly, MCP provides a universal API for connecting AI models with external systems, transforming the integration challenge from an “M×N” problem (each app to each tool) to an “M+N” problem (apps and tools each implement MCP once). [^b479a8] [^026f85] [^081ad2]

### How MCP Works

- **Architecture:** MCP uses a client-server model:
 - **Host applications:** LLM-powered tools (e.g., Claude Desktop, Copilot, AI IDEs).
 - **MCP clients:** Embedded in hosts, these handle communication with MCP servers.
 - **MCP servers:** Expose data, tools, or functions to AI systems via a standardized interface.
 - **Transport:** Communication occurs over JSON-RPC 2.0, using either local (STDIO) or remote (HTTP + SSE) channels. [^b51563] [^026f85]
- **Core Features:**
 - **Resources:** Read-only data sources (like files, databases, knowledge bases).
 - **Tools:** Functions or APIs the AI can call to perform actions.
 - **Prompts:** Predefined templates to optimize how tools/resources are used. [^b479a8] [^026f85]
- **Security & Consent:** MCP emphasizes explicit user consent, robust authorization, and clear UI for data access and tool usage. [^026f85] [^91430e]
