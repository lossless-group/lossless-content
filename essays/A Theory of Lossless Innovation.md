# Does Modern Work just Evaporate?

>[!QUOTE]
>"We need better theories." -- [[Clayton Christensen]]

As the Internet, Computing, and Mobile came into maturity, the message from capital markets became clear: A select few technology startups seem to grow at exceptional speed with very little capital expenditure beyond hiring rooms full of smart twenty somethings. Of course,  they must be pampered with ping pong tables and free lunch. Onlookers often have trouble making sense of why and how these organizations grow at this kind of speed with so few employees.

I have played some role as a go-between from the startup world to the rest of the world, as I spent about 12 years in Venture Capital, somewhere before and after as a startup cofounder. A very common experience in Venture Capital is being asked to pontificate, present, or participate on a panel, with the topics all dancing around the outside world asking for some sense as to why, say, AirBnB is more valuable than most hotel brands. Why is some four year old company raising capital at valuations higher than most well-respected brands in the market? Multiply that challenge to help sense-make many times per week over 12 years, we come up with ways of thinking and talking about things. 

Spoiler: startup success can be boiled down to how they collaborate, including the tools, techniques, and principles used in collaborating. One of these principles is to pursue platform-based business models, where their collaboration is not just internal or hierarchical, they are collaborating with partners, customers, and users across a distributed network of shared incentives and reliable behaviors.  So, **hyper-growth startups have found breakthroughs in models, tools, and techniques for collaboration**.

The more exciting insight is, ironically, just how bad everyone everywhere seems to be at long-term collaboration in business, and just how imperfect even the highest growth startups are. They are often, at best, marginally better at a few ways of collaborating than the more mature industry participants, and they are often comically worse than incumbents at most other ways of collaborating.  In other words, they are doing a few things brilliantly, but for most other things businesses need to do they are a fiasco. 

(You may have exposure to parts of the world where this may not be the case: Skyscrapers do get built, surgeons save lives in surgery.  Clearly, collaboration works in pockets. I speak of technology startups.)

This got me thinking and reflecting and discussing collaboration and productivity and value creation across different business at different stages, and suddenly I had a sixth-sense moment of "I see dead people!" -- most people I know are brilliant but commonly have the experience of working on something for a long time only to have it not go anywhere. We make presentations that get us positive feedback, then nothing happens. Projects get stalled or blocked for months on end. We spend hours writing an email that goes out and people barely skim it.  We talk to 100 potential customers to get one, and then don't find ways to properly engage the 99 we started a conversation with. We launch an idea that doesn't get traction. We make documents that no one looks at ever again, and when we need it later we have trouble finding it. Most modern humans report spending hours a day just triaging emails. Even among the most highly productive people at the most highly productive companies, we are mainly doing things that turn out to not really be a good use of time. It seems like everywhere, when viewed from the long-run and not the day-to-day grind, our productivity just evaporates. 

## AI will just create more of everything

[[concepts/Explainers for AI/Artificial Intelligence|AI]] has exploded into the world at gobsmacking speed. With [[OpenAI]]'s release of [[GPT-Series Models|GPT3]] in 2022, by 2025, 1/4th of all funded startups claim to be an AI startup.  There is something about the potential for [[concepts/Explainers for AI/Artificial Intelligence|AI]] and perhaps the memory of how profoundly the rise of Search Engines, Marketplaces, and Ad Technology (including Facebook, et all) dramatically transformed business, where it seems every business in the world is intrigued to try to use AI. 

So, for older, larger organizations, organizations that at this point may have legacy systems and processes, knowing many amazing tools exist is not enough.  Promoting individuals that moonlight to figure out how to use AI to amplify their productivity are currently not meeting broader challenges of management and leadership. 

Organizations need an overarching strategy that can guide smaller decisions — to adopt or avoid, guidelines on how to use new tools, and animating goals that align everyone involved.

And above all that, organizations need a unifying motive and story.  Tactical improvements are more valuable as part of a larger strategy, and any strategy is more valuable as part of a larger set of beliefs and animating narrative.  To have beliefs that will endure beyond the day to day dynamics, organizations need to embrace a common theory. 

We propose [[essays/A Theory of Lossless Innovation|A Theory of Lossless Innovation]].  What do we mean?  Well, let us ground it in a story, one that is a parable for the next century.  

![](https://i.imgur.com/1ZODnPi.png)

## A Parable of Directionality

On June 2, 1875, Alexander Graham Bell heard the voice of his colleague, Thomas Watson, from an unfinished contraption on his desk. Watson had been tinkering with his end of the same contraption, built as *yet another* one of their attempts at creating an "acoustic telegraph".  Bell was barely able to make out a human voice. The sound was filled with static, barely audible, but Bell instantly recognized this was the breakthrough they were seeking. This moment sparked a full century of innovation, research, engineering, capital investments, wealth creation, and public policy. Bell and Watson would have no way to understand the spark they had lit. Nine months of tinkering later, on March 10, 1876, Bell placed the first intentional call to Watson, in another room.  "Mr. Watson, come here – I want to see you."

>[!EXCERPT]
> What goes in one end should come out the other.  

From a certain vantage point and with a wide but focused lens, the arc of the history from 1875 on can be fit into a story about the relentless, collective, global pursuit of [[concepts/Lossless|Lossless]] Communication. 

Developing Bell's invention into something that could deliver audible, clear calls, reliably and over any distance would take a century.  The endeavor involved an astounding number of people, and countless inventions and technologies that had direct application to the goal at hand. From Information Theory to Cryptography, from copper wires to fiber optic cables, from switchboards to transistors, the animating story that united a vast network of institutions, companies, scientists, engineers, banks, stock markets, shareholders, etc ad nauseam.  No matter what their day to day, or their year to year, or this organization or that, they were all engaged in one pursuit: Lossless Communication.

Even more worth understanding is that the countless inventions and technologies that had no direct, immediate commercial application would go on to reinvent the whole world.  [[organizations/Bell Labs|Bell Labs]], which housed the research and development arm of the near monopoly that was AT&T at its zenith, would also spin out
- the foundations of computer-based cryptography.
- the photovoltaic cell, the pixel of solar energy. 
- charge-coupled devices, the base of digital photography and radio astronomy
- the C programming language, still in use today for any software that needs fast-execution systems programs. 
- operating systems, the software that manages computers.  UNIX, developed at Bell Labs, heavily influenced MacOS and Linux.
- cellular networks for mobile device calls and data
- lasers, which are now the primary instrument in lithography to make chips, fiber optic data transmission, realtime computer vision, untold military applications in precision weapons, and various medical procedures. 
- foundations of neural networks and machine learning, such as [[Vocabulary/Support Vector Machines]]

[[organizations/Bell Labs|Bell Labs]] was the epicenter of invention in the 20th Century. An eager read of it's hagiography, [[The Idea Factory]], or even just a perusal of it's Wikipedia page, inspires awe. Work at Bell Labs led to eleven Nobel Prizes and five Turing Awards. Their inventions defined most of the modern era. The Transistor, the Laser, photovoltaic cells, charge-coupled devices. The Unix operating system, the C, C++, and AWK programming languages. The field of Information Theory was birthed at MIT, but Claude Shannon, the creator, worked at Bell Labs for much of his life.  

From the animating, common goal of [[concepts/Lossless|Lossless]] Communication, we have most technologies that define life in the 21st Century.  

## Lossless as Analogy

>[!EXERPT]
>What goes in one end should come out the other. 

The term [[concepts/Lossless|Lossless]] has become technical, referring to algorithmic methods that reduce then reconstruct data with perfect fidelity, I posit that applying it as an analogy to almost any human pursuit will loosely predict the emergence and distribution of invention, technology, and commerce. 

To balance giving more context and getting to the point.

# Other Historical Case Studies
## Imagery

The first color photograph is attributed to [[Sources/People/James Clerk Maxwell|James Clerk Maxwell]], the image taken in 1861. 

[[organizations/Kodak|Kodak]] and [[organizations/Xerox|Xerox]] were also pursuing [[concepts/Lossless|Lossless]] goals, pursuing the goal of making images better and better, and more and more widely accessible.  

At age 24, George Eastman was planning a trip to the Caribbean for the summer of of 1878. He wanted to keep his memories. Hauling around a wet plate camera, taking pictures, and developing photos was still an unwieldy process.  2 years later, Eastman received a patent from the US Patent Office, patent 226,503, for a "Method and Apparatus for Coating Plates for Use in Photography." [^1]

After selling the first roll-film and hand camera in 1888, George Eastman founded Eastman [[organizations/Kodak|Kodak]] and was granted the patent. Kodak went on to become the market leader in photography.  It's no wonder then, a spin out service provider [[organizations/Xerox|Xerox]] became the market leader in photocopying.  

Steve Sasson was an engineer at [[organizations/Kodak|Kodak]] when he invented the [world's first digital camera](https://www.freepatentsonline.com/4131919.html) in 1975. Willis Adcock was working with [[organizations/Texas Instruments|Texas Instruments]] when he [filed a patent](https://www.freepatentsonline.com/4057830.html) for a digital camera in 1977. [^2]   

[[organizations/Xerox|Xerox]] developed [[organizations/PARC|PARC]] in 1970, based near [[organizations/Stanford University|Stanford University]] in Palo Alto, CA as it pursued [[concepts/Lossless|Lossless]] image duplication. PARC follows [[organizations/Bell Labs|Bell Labs]] closely in the sheer number of inventions that have managed to reinvent our world. Wikipedia lists major inventions as: 
- the Personal Computer, 
- the Graphical User Interface, 
- the Ethernet, 
- Object-Oriented Programming, 
- the Mouse, 
- the VSLI design for semiconductors. 

## Sound

On the success of AT&T, many brilliant inventors were searching for a wireless method of transmitting data.  Guglielmo Marconi was the first to crack it, sending a transmission 1.5 miles, or 2.4km, in 1895. By 1897, he was sending signals 34 miles, 55km, within England. By 1899, he sent signals across the English Channel. December 23 1900, and file for patent, renaming his corporate entity as Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company.  In 1908, Marconi was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. 
## Data

[[organizations/DARPA|DARPA]] did not have a vision for the Internet.  As America entered the Nuclear Age, the American Defense establishment became paranoid that a single bomb could wipe out all of their data.  [[organizations/DARPA|DARPA]] published its usual challenge to the public: invent a way to network computers so we could make data redundant. 

[[Vocabulary/Multi-Modal Databases|Multi-Modal Databases]]

## Memories

Facebook and LinkedIn could be thought of as networks of humans trying to keep (not lose) their relationships or their memories. For a long time, Facebook was just a way to hare photos and "tag" the people featured in the photos. 
## Human Nature

Similar to [[Mimetic Theory]], to pursue [[concepts/Lossless|Lossless]] goals is part of human nature itself.  Decades of research in [[Behavioral Economics]] have demonstrated that [[Loss Aversion]] is one of the most powerful of human motives.
