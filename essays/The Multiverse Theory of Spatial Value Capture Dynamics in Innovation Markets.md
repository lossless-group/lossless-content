Band-Based, Concentric Doughnut Shaped Standard Model Network Topology & Physics

2) Value Capture follows a multidimensional Pareto curve, with centers of value capture showing exponentially greater "heat."  
3) There is a "gravitational" and "magnetic" like force that describes how capital flow entities (CFEs) can move closer and further from the "hot" center, with CFEs encountering push and pull forces, and repulsion or propulsion forces, from statistical "Bands" of Normal Distribution. from concentric doughnut shaped zones. 
4) In any doughnut zone, forces are stronger as they approach the edge of the next zone, in inverse proportion to the gravitational forces of any "band" center. 
5) VFEs may thus use momentum within external forces as the primary travel propulsion.
6) Various strategies and tactics may catalyze a "leap", operating as a shortcut through space-time. 
7) Each object in Spatial Value exhibits forces on every other CFE. As CFEs become closer, cluster-heat creates rapid and chaotic movement within a cluster of CFEs.
