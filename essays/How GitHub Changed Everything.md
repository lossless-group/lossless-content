GitHub launched in 2009, and almost immediately became the primary code version control tool of new technology startups. From there, it's growth was meteoric and exponential. [^4]

>"GitHub is like the air we breathe. It’s such a natural part of the way we work that sometimes we don’t even notice it. We cannot imagine living without GitHub.” **Ryuzo Yamamoto** // Software Engineer, [Souzoh](https://github.com/customer-stories/mercari) [^3]

Slowly but surely, GitHub has become and will continue to get better at being the "everything" tool for collaborative software development. Smaller development teams already find no reason to adopt [[Workflow Management]] tools like [[Linear]]. [[GitHub]] sports "just-good-enough" Task Management, written [about on their Docs here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/about-task-lists).  They use [[emergent-innovation/Standards/Markdown]] inspired writing functionality, which extends basic text in many versatile ways. ^[1]

You can find little libraries that can speed you up considerably, such as [Swapy](https://github.com/TahaSh/swapy) Major collaborations on web security are now performed over GitHub, including [Portable Open SSH](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable) [[GitHub]] has also become a public repository for computational work in science, with similar functionality as peer review. 

The social network and community features of [[GitHub]] enable new [[Decision Heuristics]] in evaluating potential software solutions in the adoption process. [^2] 

[[GitHub]] has become the mainstay in the development and adoption of [[Open Source]] software. Every year, they publish the premier industry report, the [Octoverse](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/), which uses data on the [[GitHub]] platform. 

Taking a step back, the Enlightenment and Scientific Revolution developed a complex, emergent system of codifying and sharing knowledge: the endgame of academic work became the publication of an article to a peer reviewed journal. For those now doing their work by using programming languages to do computational work, they actually just use [[GitHub]] (which probably doesn't affect hiring and tenure at academic institutions yet, but...). Take for example this code base for analyzing DNA -- [Dart-Eval: A Comprehensive DNA Language Model Evaluation Benchmark on Regulatory DNA](https://github.com/kundajelab/DART-Eval).

[[GitHub]] is now serving the same function as staying up-to-speed with evolving knowledge as going to a University library and pouring over recent journal publications. Therefore, watching trending code bases on [[GitHub]] now has dramatic effects on knowledge dissemination. 

##### AI Explains [[GitHub]]

> 
> - **Version Control with Git Integration**: By integrating Git, a distributed version control system, GitHub allows developers to track changes, roll back to previous versions, and collaborate seamlessly.
> - **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**: GitHub Actions (introduced in 2019) has enabled automation of workflows, reducing manual overhead and speeding up the development cycle.
> - **Pull Requests and Code Reviews**: GitHub popularized features like pull requests, which streamline the process of proposing, discussing, and integrating code changes, ensuring higher code quality.
> 
> #### **Traction Data:**
> 
> - As of 2023, **100 million developers** use GitHub, up from 28 million in 2018, reflecting its widespread adoption.
> - Over **372 million repositories** are hosted on GitHub, a testament to its role in global software development.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 2. **Creating an Open-Source Collaboration Ethos**
> 
> GitHub has catalyzed the growth of the open-source movement by providing a platform where developers can share, contribute to, and reuse code.
> 
> - **Accessibility and Community**: GitHub has made it easy for anyone to contribute to open-source projects, breaking down barriers to entry.
> - **Popular Open-Source Projects**: Projects like **Linux**, **React**, **TensorFlow**, and **Kubernetes** thrive on GitHub, powered by millions of contributors worldwide.
> - **Knowledge Sharing**: GitHub’s README files, wikis, and issue trackers have made it a hub for documenting and sharing software knowledge.
> 
> #### **Traction Data:**
> 
> - GitHub's **"State of the Octoverse 2022"** report highlighted that **94 million developers** contributed to open-source projects that year.
> - In 2022, **3.5 billion contributions** (commits, pull requests, etc.) were made, showing the platform’s scale as a collaboration tool.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 3. **Accelerating Innovation**
> 
> GitHub has reduced the time and effort required to bring new technologies to market by enabling developers to build on existing work rather than starting from scratch.
> 
> - **Code Reusability**: Developers can fork repositories, clone projects, and use libraries or frameworks hosted on GitHub, significantly reducing development time.
> - **Rapid Prototyping**: GitHub makes it easy to experiment and iterate on ideas, promoting agile methodologies.
> - **Open-Source Foundations for Startups**: Many startups and tech giants, including **Netflix**, **Airbnb**, and **Uber**, have leveraged open-source technologies hosted on GitHub to build their core products.
> 
> #### **Traction Data:**
> 
> - GitHub reports that **90% of companies use open-source software** in some capacity, much of which is hosted on GitHub.
> - Over **20,000 open-source projects** are actively maintained by Fortune 500 companies on GitHub.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 4. **Democratizing Software Development**
> 
> GitHub has lowered the barrier to entry for learning to code and participating in software development by providing free tools, educational resources, and a vibrant community.
> 
> - **Free Access to Tools**: GitHub offers free repositories, enabling anyone to start coding without financial constraints.
> - **GitHub Education**: Programs like **GitHub Student Developer Pack** provide free access to premium tools and resources for students.
