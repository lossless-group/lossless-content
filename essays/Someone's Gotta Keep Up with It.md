# Every few months

Since the launch of GPT-3 in June 2020, major “shake-up” AI models that significantly impact developers have been released roughly every 6–12 months, sometimes even more frequently in recent years[^0sn4rl][^93ow3w][^le0xqp][^w1hax6][^ho7gd7][^34oscb][^r1z5tc]. This trend has accelerated notably since 2023, with several key releases annually and intensified competition from Chinese tech giants and indie labs.

## Why These Models Matter
- **Context expansion**: Each new model often brings substantial increases in context window or memory, which directly affects app design and prompts developers to rework interfaces and backend systems[^kcj7tj][^o68b8j][^le0xqp][^34oscb].
- **Multimodal capabilities**: When multimodal models like GPT-4, Gemini, or LLaMA 4 drop, developers rapidly pivot to add image, audio, or video inputs and outputs[^kcj7tj][^o68b8j][^on3lm5].
- **API and performance changes**: Updates like GPT-4 Turbo or Mixtral deliver new pricing, latency, and reliability considerations that force app and infrastructure architecture updates[^bb1c1k][^34oscb].
- **Safety/Guardrails**: Major releases from Anthropic (Claude) or OpenAI often push new standards in prompt engineering and model alignment, driving quick policy and app modifications[^c298wc][^ho7gd7][^9gjfmr].
- **Open-source releases**: When powerful models become openly available (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral, DeepSeek, OpenAI’s GPT-OSS series), developers globally reassess their stacks given lowered cost and increased flexibility[^50assh][^34oscb][^ql0lve][^39b1k7].

## Recent Frequency Trends (2023–2025)
- **Global developer “shake-up” events:** There have been at least **2–4 globally influential releases per year** since mid-2023, with 2024 and 2025 showing increasing frequency (every 3–6 months)[^ho7gd7][^34oscb][^on3lm5][^r1z5tc].
- **Regional waves:** With Chinese (DeepSeek, ERNIE, Qwen), UAE (Falcon), and indie European labs (Mistral), the pace is only quickening—often with effects on developers localized by language, cost, or API adoption[^dm2yar][^4v3cls][^r1z5tc][^34oscb].

## Overall Estimate
A major, developer-impacting AI model comes out on average **every 3–6 months** as of 2024–2025, with some cycles seeing monthly shifts due to cascading open-source and region-specific breakthroughs[^34oscb][^cpire1][^on3lm5][^ho7gd7]. Most notable disruptions require engineers to rapidly adapt tools, prompts, workflows, and sometimes entire products.

> If working with AI, developers should expect fundamental changes at least twice per year, and often much more frequently.

The pace of change is happening at greater and greater speeds

Now let me create a comprehensive table displaying this timeline

## Key Insights

**OpenAI Leadership**: Started the modern LLM era with GPT-3 in June 2020, [^yuvqy4] followed by consistent innovation through GPT-3.5, [^czl8su] GPT-4, [^beb80l] and o1 reasoning models. [^ot2tn3]

**Chinese Innovation**: Major players include Baidu (ERNIE series), [^4ymfau] Alibaba (Qwen family), [^hcajs1] DeepSeek (breakthrough efficiency models), [^n1tgc9] and academic institutions like BAAI (Wu Dao series). [^zoej3v]

**Open Source Movement**: EleutherAI pioneered open alternatives with GPT-J and GPT-NeoX, [^1whs3f] followed by BigScience BLOOM, [^o1gtnw] Meta's LLaMA series, [^oz1pr0] and Mistral AI's efficient models. [^n2trtc]

**Multimodal Evolution**: From text-only models to multimodal capabilities, with Google's Gemini, [^0gi5pf] OpenAI's GPT-4o, [^sshg25] and Meta's LLaMA 4[^dwv8ck] leading vision integration.

**Indie Success Stories**: Mistral AI emerged as a European champion, [^n2trtc] TII's Falcon models represent Middle Eastern AI advancement, [^w7wo8g] and companies like Cohere focus on enterprise RAG applications.

**Recent Trends**: 2025 has seen a focus on reasoning models (DeepSeek-R1, [^n1tgc9] Claude 4[^rv1mzc]), efficiency improvements, and the democratization of powerful AI through open-weight releases.
