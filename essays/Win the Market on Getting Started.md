image_prompt: 'On the left, a software engineering team of geeks is building a bus from spare parts.  Parts are all over the ground, they have grease and sweat all over their faces and hands. The bus looks far from finished.  On the right, a bus is already built and new and fancy.  The bus door is open, and the same software engineering team characters are clean and calm, getting on the bus with a ticket in hand.'

As products and services mature, they tend to get more and more complicated to serve more and more customers who have more and more demands. Over time designers and product managers generally add more ideas and features to their products and services. This is a natural progression of the market, but it can be a barrier to entry for new customers. 

The result is often product suites that are intimidatingly complex for new customers to navigate. 

## From Scarcity to Abundance

For a long time, if you were doing business you used Microsoft Office. If you were doing design or creative work you used the Adobe Suite. 

As Internet and Mobile changed the dynamics of reaching and serving customers, new tools emerged. More accurately, entrepreneurs designed and delivered new options.  

Hundreds of Billions in value have been created just by making software that is easy to get started with.
