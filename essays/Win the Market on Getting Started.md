image_prompt: On the left, a software engineering team of geeks is building a bus from spare parts.  Parts are all over the ground, they have grease and sweat all over their faces and hands. The bus looks far from finished.  On the right, a bus is already built and new and fancy.  The bus door is open, and the same software engineering team characters are clean and calm, getting on the bus with a ticket in hand.
