We are entering an era where knowledge work will reorganize from the "workshop" model to an "assembly line" model. 

The statement you've presented suggests a significant shift in how knowledge work might be structured, moving away from traditional models toward something resembling an industrial assembly line. Here’s a breakdown of what this could entail:

### Current Model: The Workshop

1. **Flexibility and Autonomy**: In the "workshop" model, individuals often have considerable autonomy over their tasks and schedules. This is akin to artisans who control the entire process from start to finish.
   
2. **Creativity and Innovation**: There's typically more room for creativity as professionals can approach problems in diverse ways.

3. **Cross-disciplinary Collaboration**: Workers frequently collaborate across disciplines, leveraging a wide range of expertise.

4. **Project-based Work**: Tasks are often defined by projects with varying timelines and objectives, allowing workers to adapt their roles as needed.

### Proposed Model: The Assembly Line

1. **Standardization**: Like an assembly line in manufacturing, tasks could become more standardized and segmented into smaller, repetitive components.
   
2. **Efficiency Focus**: This model emphasizes speed and efficiency, potentially reducing the time it takes to complete individual tasks by breaking them down into simpler parts.

3. **Specialized Roles**: Workers might be assigned highly specialized roles focusing on specific aspects of a project rather than overseeing entire processes.

4. **Continuous Workflow**: There could be an emphasis on maintaining continuous workflow with minimal downtime, similar to how assembly lines operate in factories.

### Implications

- **Pros**:
  - Increased productivity and efficiency.
  - Potentially lower costs due to streamlined processes.
  - Easier scalability as tasks are broken down into more manageable units.

- **Cons**:
  - Reduced creativity and innovation opportunities for individuals.
  - Potential loss of job satisfaction due to repetitive work.
  - Risk of devaluing holistic understanding in favor of task completion.

### Considerations

1. **Technology**: Automation and AI will likely play a crucial role in enabling this shift, handling routine tasks while humans focus on oversight and complex problem-solving.

2. **Human Factors**: Balancing efficiency with job satisfaction is key to ensuring that workers remain motivated and engaged.

3. **Adaptability**: Organizations must be adaptable, finding ways to integrate the benefits of both models where applicable.

Ultimately, this transition could redefine how knowledge work is perceived and executed, requiring careful consideration of its broader impacts on workforce dynamics and organizational culture.

As we are living it, we often miss the radically historic shifts that are happening around us.  We miss their implications, and miss the opportunities they generate.  

So let us go back to the future. 

> I think we have been working in collaborative workshops. We will be working in collaborative supply chains.

Up until well into the industrial revolution, industries were mainly organized by guilds of skilled tradesman. Products were designed and manufactured in workshops, their component parts were either made in-house or sourced through local, or sometimes regional networks. 



It wasn't until the late 1700s that the concept of interchangeable parts began its path to widespread adoption, largely through the booming musket industry fueled by the French and American revolutions. Needing larger and larger numbers of men to leave their farms, pick up arms, and shoot at one another, Thomas Jefferson returned from France having observed the French success at standardizing cannons and cannonball production, and the nifty application of standardization to flintlocks on muskets. Flintlocks were the part most likely to break or be defective, so a standardized make enabled those men whose muskets were acting up to quickly fix them with a replacement part. Jefferson put in motion what is likely the first American Government RFP process, and Eli Whitney of Cotton Gin fame was awarded the largest contract. As the Whitney Armory had to build all of the interchangeable parts themselves, it had to set up a series of workshops that specialized in component parts. The process really wasn't mastered and used until 1827.

The concept of Division of Labor was introduced by Adam Smith himself in The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776. Automating the production process for anything wasn't achieved until 1785, when Oliver Evans celebrated his automatic flour mill.
