According to [[Poe AI]]:

> [!AI explains business configuration]
> The term **business configuration** refers to the way a company designs and organizes its key components—such as strategy, structure, processes, resources, and capabilities—to achieve its goals and deliver value to customers. It describes how all the elements of a business are aligned and configured to create competitive advantage, maximize efficiency, and drive growth.

> 2. **Structure**: How the business is organized internally, including its hierarchy, departments, roles, and communication flows.

>     - Example: A flat structure for a startup to encourage collaboration, or a divisional structure for a multinational company focusing on regional markets.
> 3. **Processes**: The systems and workflows that support operations, production, service delivery, and decision-making.
>     
>     - Example: Lean manufacturing processes for efficiency or agile development processes for flexibility.
> 4. **Resources and Capabilities**: The allocation and management of resources (e.g., financial, human, technological) and the development of core capabilities (e.g., innovation, customer service, supply chain management).
>     
>     - Example: Amazon’s configuration includes advanced logistics and technology-driven capabilities for customer satisfaction.
> 5. **Value Chain**: The configuration of activities that create value, from inbound logistics to marketing and customer support.
>     
>     - Example: Zara’s tightly integrated design, production, and distribution system allows rapid response to fashion trends.
> 6. **Ecosystem and Partnerships**: How the business interacts with external stakeholders such as suppliers, distributors, and partners.
>     
>     - Example: Tesla’s configuration includes strategic partnerships for battery production and charging infrastructure.
> 7. **Technology and Infrastructure**: The tools, platforms, and systems that enable operations and innovation.
