[Markdown Syntax documentation](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

Ruby has [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/)

The [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/) spec and associated technology is heavily based on Markdown.  

The number of editors have just been exploding.  [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) is in-browser, pretty lean, and loved by a small number.
