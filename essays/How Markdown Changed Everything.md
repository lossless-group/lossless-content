[Markdown Syntax documentation](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

Ruby has [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/)

The [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/) spec and associated technology is heavily based on Markdown.  

The number of editors have just been exploding.  [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) is in-browser, pretty lean, and loved by a small number.  

## Perplexity Query (2025-07-19T18:30:47.320Z)
**Question:** How has Markdown changed everything?
**Model:** sonar-pro

Markdown has fundamentally transformed the way people create, share, and preserve digital text by introducing a **simpler, open, and human-readable syntax** that separates content from formatting[3][4][5]. This shift has led to several key changes:

- **Democratization of Formatting:** Markdown broke the dominance of proprietary, closed formats (like Microsoft Word), making formatted text accessible and editable in plain text by anyone, without specific or expensive software[1][3]. This reduced the "formatting fetish"—the obsession with complex formatting tools—and shifted focus back to the actual content[1].
- **Explosive Adoption:** Markdown's simplicity has fueled a surge in adoption, especially among programmers, writers, and modern apps. Its syntax has influenced numerous tools (e.g., Kramdown with Ruby, Leanpub for publishing, and browser-based editors like Dillinger), and it is now implemented across platforms— from websites and blogs to note-taking apps and even chat platforms (WhatsApp, Discord)[2][3].
- **Interoperability and Longevity:** Because Markdown files are plain text, they are easily portable, version-controlled, and preserved over time, avoiding the obsolescence risk tied to closed or complex file formats[4]. This enhances collaboration and ensures your writing isn’t locked into a specific application or ecosystem.
- **Influence on Workflow and AI:** Markdown is widely integrated with developer workflows (for documentation, README files, etc.) and supported deeply in major platforms like GitHub and Visual Studio Code[1]. It also smoothly complements AI-driven tools: content can be generated, styled, and transmitted in Markdown, without the need for heavy applications or local software.
- **Enabling New Interfaces:** Markdown’s readable syntax enables live preview and conversion to web formats (HTML, PDF, etc.), helping bridge the gap between simple writing and complex publishing without requiring specialized technical knowledge[4].

Despite these breakthroughs, Markdown still faces some **challenges**:
- **Fragmentation:** There is no universal standard. Different apps and platforms support slightly different “flavors” of Markdown, occasionally leading to incompatibilities[3][5].
- **Limited Advanced Features:** Markdown’s minimalist approach can make it less suited for complex document needs, like tracked changes or intricate layouts, compared to word processors[3].
- **Professional Limitations:** Without continued development and better tooling support, Markdown may remain more common among developers and everyday usage, rather than fully displacing advanced professional software[3].

In essence, **Markdown has "changed everything" by lowering barriers to rich text creation and sharing**, fostering an ecosystem of open tools, and shaping the digital authoring landscape for a new generation[1][2][3][4].
