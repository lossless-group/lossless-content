# Vision

To use [[concepts/Explainers for AI/AI Web Research|AI Web Research]] , [[Vocabulary/Large Language Models|Large Language Models]], and [[concepts/Explainers for AI/AI Powered Data Capture|AI Powered Data Capture]] to augment basic data sets.  These augmentations will need a workflow that involves a set of tools, each with their own purpose as part of the multi-step workflow.  

## Microservices and Microfrontends Architecture

Each one of the steps of the data augmentation workflow can be thought of as its own application, as it should. 

We need to use [[Tooling/Software Development/Developer Experience/DevOps/Docker|Docker]] and [[Vocabulary/Module Federation|Module Federation]], and because [[Tooling/Software Development/Frameworks/Web Frameworks/React|React]] goes with [[Tooling/Software Development/Frameworks/Web Frameworks/NEXT.js|NEXT.js]], and [[Tooling/Software Development/Frameworks/Web Frameworks/NEXT.js|NEXT.js]] needs [[Tooling/Software Development/Developer Experience/DevTools/Vite|Vite]], 

### Tech Stack Considerations
TypeScript, WebSockets or REST APIs for communication with microfrontend and other services, and a suitable database (like PostgreSQL or MongoDB) for storage.

1. **Module Federation**
    
    We will use [[Vocabulary/Module Federation|Module Federation]] to share components and logic between the main app and the [[Vocabulary/Microfrontend Architecture|Microfrontends]]. This approach allows us to maintain a modular architecture while enabling seamless interaction between parts of the system.
    
    - **Key Implementation Details:**
	    - Likely going with [[Tooling/Software Development/Developer Experience/DevTools/Turborepo|Turborepo]] by [[Tooling/Software Development/Cloud Infrastructure/Vercel|Vercel]] since we are hosting on Vercel and using [[Tooling/Software Development/Frameworks/Web Frameworks/NEXT.js|NEXT.js]]
        - Define shared providers (like AI search model, web crawler, or CRM data access) that can be consumed by both the main application and the Prompt Manager microfrontend.
        - Implement communication patterns (e.g., using Events or Remote Procedure Calls) to facilitate interaction between federation providers.
