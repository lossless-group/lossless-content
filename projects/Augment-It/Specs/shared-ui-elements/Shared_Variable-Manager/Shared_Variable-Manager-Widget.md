The [[projects/Augment-It/Specs/shared-ui-elements/Shared_Variable-Manager/Shared_Variable-Manager-Widget|Shared Variable Manager]] is a Widget giving the user an interface to create variables as key value pairs, they may be created from selected text as either the value or the key. They will be able to map keys to values in instances where they are selecting from structured data, such as from the [[projects/Augment-It/Specs/apps/RecordCollector|RecordCollector]]

that will might be used in:

|     | select text from the [[projects/Augment-It/Specs/apps/ResponseReviewer\|ResponseReviewer]] and creating a variable by naming the key.
