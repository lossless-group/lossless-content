## Purpose
Using the highlights, the [[projects/Augment-It/Specs/apps-microfrontends/InsightAssembler|InsightAssembler]] [[Microfrontend Architecture|Microfrontend]] will yet again use prompts to organize, analyze, summarize, and template or format to data structures.

Once the "Insights" are in the form that can be pushed via API call to target systems, particularly [[Tooling/Software Development/Developer Experience/DevTools/ProductBoard|ProductBoard]], [[Salesforce]], and [[organizations/Dovetail]].
