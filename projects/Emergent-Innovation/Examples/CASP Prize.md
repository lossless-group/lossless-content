Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) is a bienniel competition overseen by the [[organizations/Protein Structure Prediction Center]]. [[organizations/DeepMind]], acquired by [[organizations/Google]], worked on [[AlphaFold]] to pursue the [[projects/Emergent-Innovation/Examples/CASP Prize]], and they were awarded the prize in 2022.  They co-received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2024. 

According to [[Poe AI]]:

> [!AI explains]
> The **CASP Prize** (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction) is part of a prestigious biennial competition that evaluates the accuracy of protein structure prediction methods. It originated in **1994** to address one of biology’s fundamental challenges: **predicting how proteins fold into their 3D structures from their amino acid sequences**.
> 
> #### Background: The Protein Folding Problem
> 
> Proteins are complex molecules essential for all living organisms. Their function depends critically on their 3D shape, which is determined by how a chain of amino acids folds into a specific structure. However, predicting this folding process has been a monumental challenge in molecular biology, often referred to as the **protein folding problem**.
> 
> - Despite advances in experimental techniques like X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, determining protein structures experimentally is time-consuming and expensive.
> - CASP was created to assess and drive progress in **computational methods** for predicting protein structures, with the ultimate goal of accelerating this discovery process.
> 
> #### CASP Competition
> 
> - Every two years, organizers of CASP provide participants with experimental data on protein structures that have not yet been published. Competitors must predict the 3D structures of these proteins using computational models.
> - Predictions are evaluated against the experimentally determined structures to measure their accuracy.
> - CASP has become a driving force in computational biology, catalyzing innovation and collaboration in the field.
> 
> #### Major Breakthrough: AlphaFold
> 
> In the 14th CASP competition in **2020**, a revolutionary breakthrough occurred when **AlphaFold**, an artificial intelligence system developed by **DeepMind**, achieved unprecedented accuracy in protein structure prediction. For many proteins, AlphaFold’s predictions were as accurate as experimental results, marking a watershed moment in solving the protein folding problem.

> ### How Protein Folding May Impact the World
> 
> Understanding how proteins fold—and being able to predict their structures—has transformative implications for numerous fields. Here are some of the ways this breakthrough can impact the world:
> 
> #### 1. **Drug Discovery and Medicine**
> 
> - Proteins are central to nearly all biological processes, and many diseases are caused by misfolded proteins or dysfunctional protein interactions.
> - With accurate protein structure predictions, researchers can:
>     - Design drugs that specifically target disease-causing proteins.
>     - Develop new treatments for conditions like cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease.
>     - Accelerate vaccine development by modeling how proteins interact with pathogens (e.g., during the COVID-19 pandemic).
> 
> #### 2. **Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology**
> 
> - Protein folding predictions enable the engineering of custom proteins with specific functions, such as:
>     - Enzymes for industrial processes (e.g., creating biofuels or breaking down plastic waste).
>     - Proteins for use in agriculture, such as pest-resistant crops or drought-tolerant plants.
> 
> #### 3. **Understanding Evolution and Disease**
> 
> - By comparing protein structures across species, scientists can gain new insights into evolution and the molecular basis of life.
> - Misfolded proteins are implicated in diseases like prion disorders and cystic fibrosis. Predicting how proteins misfold could lead to better diagnostic tools and therapies.
> 
> #### 4. **Environmental and Energy Applications**
> 
> - Enzymes could be designed to accelerate the breakdown of pollutants or to capture and store carbon dioxide.
> - Proteins can also be engineered to produce renewable energy sources, such as hydrogen.
> 
> #### 5. **Advancing Basic Science**
> 
> - Protein folding predictions provide insights into fundamental biological processes, helping researchers answer questions about how life works at the molecular level.
