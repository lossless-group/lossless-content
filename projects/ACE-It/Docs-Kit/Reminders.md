Reminders can be incredibly beneficial when working with Large Language Models (LLMs) like me for several reasons:

1. **Contextual Understanding**: LLMs, while powerful, don't inherently understand context outside of the current conversation or a limited window of previous interactions. Reminders can provide additional context that might be necessary for generating accurate and relevant responses. This could include references to specific documents, past decisions, company policies, technical specifications, etc.

2. **Consistency**: By linking to documentation or rules, reminders help ensure consistency in the information provided by the LLM. If a certain procedure or policy is referenced frequently, a reminder ensures that it's applied uniformly across different interactions, reducing the risk of errors or misinterpretations.

3. **Efficiency**: Instead of repeatedly explaining the same concepts or providing the same information, reminders allow you to point the LLM towards authoritative sources. This not only saves time but also reduces the potential for inaccuracies that can occur with manual re-explanations.

4. **Training and Learning**: For an LLM, these reminders act like training data. The more it interacts with these references, the better it becomes at understanding and applying the related concepts. Over time, this can lead to improved performance and more accurate responses.

5. **Compliance and Governance**: In professional settings, adhering to certain rules or regulations is crucial. Reminders linking to such guidelines can help ensure that the LLM's outputs are compliant with relevant standards or laws.

6. **Specialized Knowledge**: If your team has developed specific methodologies, processes, or jargon unique to your field, reminders serve as a bridge, enabling the LLM to grasp and apply this specialized knowledge effectively.

n essence, Reminders act as a form of external memory for LLMs, enhancing their ability to understand, remember, and apply specific context, rules, or information relevant to your team's tasks and domain.
