#### Introduction

This repository contains the content for the Lossless site.  The site can be found as the 'site' directory in the monorepo, or [the Github Repo](https://github.com/lossless-group/lossless-site.git)

# Context
We have been trying to serve Laerdal in multiple ways. 

One of those ways is tailored "thought leadership" in the form of essays, articles, explainers, and other content. Most of the threads in the content repo look "undeveloped" because the plan is actually to run scripts through local LLMs and AI powered Web Scrapers to generate the content.  

Another way is "consulting" on technology adoption.  This has required hundreds of hours of research and link collection, analysis, and tech influencer mapping.  

Yet another way is acting as an R&D lab for new approaches or technology stacks, that can operate outside of their internal engineering teams. In some ways, I've been focused on making "Vibe Coding" dance. 

## There is a Vision
There is a vision for reducing content and data to Markdown and JSON. The theory is that once you know how to reduce and expand content and data into its most basal forms, that it is an unlock for AI to generate, augment, or clean and format content and data. 

### Obsidian as the Content Manager
Part of the infinite loop I have been in is that Astro and Obsidian treat markdown just differently enough to create a lot of pain.

## There will be a process
