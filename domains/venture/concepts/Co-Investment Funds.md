> ### **Response from sonar-pro**:

**Co-investment funds** are structuring a major trend in private markets, allowing limited partners (LPs) to invest directly alongside a general partner (GP) or fund manager in specific deals, often with reduced fees and enhanced transparency. [^v30auz] [^wfxq10] [^hwnuz4] [^xyjap3] These funds are especially notable for offering investors greater control and access to high-conviction, targeted investments compared to traditional pooled structures.

### The Trend of Co-Investment Funds in Private Markets

- **Definition**: A co-investment fund pools capital from investors to participate directly in individual deals, often as minority investors, alongside a lead sponsor or GP. [^v30auz] [^xyjap3] Investors thus select which transactions to join, offering more flexibility but requiring greater diligence and access.

- **Growth Drivers**:
  - **Reduced Fees**: Co-investments typically involve lower or no management or performance fees compared to traditional funds, increasing net returns for LPs. [^wfxq10] [^hwnuz4]
  - **Access and Control**: LPs get *deal-by-deal transparency* and can actively choose which investments to back, as opposed to blind pool commitments. [^h13fkl] [^hwnuz4]
  - **Diversification and Relationships**: By participating in select deals across markets, LPs improve diversification and build strategic relationships with GPs. [^wfxq10]

- **Typical Structure**: GPs syndicate co-investment capacity to key LPs, often those with established relationships or scale. Unlike fund investments, co-investments are made separately and directly into the target company, giving LPs ownership on the same terms as the GP but usually in a more passive role.

### Marquee Examples of Co-Investment Funds

While many funds offer co-investment side vehicles, several prominent examples include:

- **Adams Street Partners Co-Investment Program**: Known for leveraging deep relationships with GPs and offering LPs curated co-investment opportunities across geographies and sectors. [^wfxq10]
- **Hamilton Lane Co-Investment Funds**: Delivers co-investment vehicles with preferential fees and deal access by syndicating alongside leading sponsors. [^h13fkl]
- **Blackstone and Carlyle**: These leading private equity firms frequently offer co-investments to select LPs to enable larger transactions and strengthen LP relationships. [^xyjap3]
- **Family Offices and Institutional Investors**: Increasingly pools capital into dedicated co-investment vehicles to access direct deals and bypass high-fee structures. [^hwnuz4]

### Co-Investment in Venture Capital (VC)

In the **VC context**, co-investment funds have become a popular strategic tool:

- **Mechanism**: VC co-investments function similarly to those in PE, allowing select LPs or outside investors to invest directly in a startup round alongside the VC lead. [^v30auz]
- **Motivation**: VCs may seek co-investors to increase round size, manage capital concentration risk, or bring strategic value through their networks.
- **Fee Advantage**: Co-investment participants often pay reduced or no management/carry fees compared to main VC funds. [^v30auz] [^wfxq10]
- **Examples**:
  - **Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz**: These firms often syndicate co-investment opportunities to large LPs or strategic partners in later-stage rounds.
  - **Angel Networks and Corporate VC arms**: Frequently act as co-investors in rounds led by institutional venture funds, especially in growth or pre-IPO stages.

VC co-investment funds face special considerations:
- *Speed*: VC rounds close quickly, requiring co-investors with agility and pre-existing relationships.
- *Diligence*: Co-investors rely heavily on the lead VC's due diligence and thesis.
- *Access*: Only select LPs or partners typically receive invitations, reinforcing the importance of network and reputation.

**Key Points**

- **Co-investment funds** enable direct exposure, lower costs, and greater flexibility in both private equity and venture capital settings. [^v30auz] [^h13fkl] [^wfxq10] [^hwnuz4] [^xyjap3]
- Some leading co-investment funds are operated by Adams Street Partners, Hamilton Lane, and through side vehicles by major PE and VC sponsors.
- In **venture capital**, co-investments are rising—especially in later-stage or large rounds—to enable large checks, distribute risk, and give strategic LPs access to high-potential deals with minimal fees.

These trends indicate continued evolution toward customization, transparency, and partnership between investors and fund managers in private markets.
