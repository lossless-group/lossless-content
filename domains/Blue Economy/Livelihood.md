> **Question:**
> When a foundation is focused on "Livelihoods" what do they mean?  How can they impact livelihoods?  Any success stories?
> 
> ### **Response from sonar-pro**:

A foundation focused on **“Livelihoods”** aims to strengthen the ways individuals and communities secure their basic needs—such as food, shelter, and income—by supporting sustainable, resilient, and long-term means of making a living. [^nsus4w] [^yy00ht] [^5phx4d] This approach does not only address immediate material needs, but also seeks to empower people toward economic independence, dignity, and self-reliance. [^nsus4w]

### What Does "Livelihoods" Mean?

- **Livelihoods** refers to the means and resources individuals and communities use to secure the necessities of life (food, shelter, clothing, income). [^nsus4w] [^yy00ht] [^5phx4d]
- A **sustainable livelihood** means the ability to provide for oneself and one’s family over the long term, while also being able to recover from external stresses or shocks (e.g., economic downturns, natural disasters). [^5phx4d] [^yy00ht]
- It encompasses activities like employment, farming, entrepreneurship, vocational skills, and natural resource management that build economic resilience and community well-being. [^nsus4w] [^yy00ht]

### How Foundations Can Impact Livelihoods

Foundations influence livelihoods through targeted **programs and investments** that help people build assets, learn skills, and access resources. Typical methods include:

- **Skills Training:** Offering vocational education and entrepreneurship training to improve employability or support business creation. [^nsus4w] [^yy00ht]
- **Access to Finance:** Enabling microfinance, savings groups, and concessional loans to help individuals and communities start small businesses or improve productivity. [^yy00ht] [^z0hgcc]
- **Infrastructure Development:** Building or improving infrastructure (e.g., rural electrification, water supply, digital banking) to help communities connect with markets and services. [^z0hgcc]
- **Health Improvements:** Supporting disease prevention, maternal and child health, and nutrition—since better health is strongly linked to economic productivity. [^z0hgcc]
- **Agricultural Support:** Assisting smallholder farmers to increase crop yields and livestock production, which improves food security and income. [^z0hgcc]

### Success Stories and Impact Examples

- **Lives and Livelihoods Fund (Gates Foundation):** By combining grants and low-interest loans across 30 of the least-wealthy member states of the Islamic Development Bank, the fund empowers communities through:
    - *Improved health programs* like malaria and polio vaccination.
    - *Agricultural investments* that help smallholder farmers increase their productivity.
    - *Infrastructure projects*, such as rural electrification and improved water supply, fostering steps toward prosperity and self-reliance. [^z0hgcc]

- **AFCA Livelihoods Program (American Foundation for Children with AIDS):** This program provides long-term, trauma-resilient livelihoods for families affected by AIDS by:
    - Supplying livestock, seeds, and training so families can grow food and generate income, thus lifting children out of hunger and dependency. [^5phx4d]

- **Community Aquaculture Initiatives:** Programs supporting community-run aquaculture (e.g., seaweed farming) offer sustainable income sources while incentivizing environmental stewardship. [^yy00ht] These ventures may not cover all social costs but crucially improve personal and household financial security.
