> ### **Response from sonar-pro**:

**Net Zero Targets** are commitments by countries, companies, or other entities to **reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to as close to zero as possible and balance any remaining emissions through removal methods**, such as carbon capture or reforestation, by a specified date—often 2050. [^rdyfq8] [^t9lvrf] [^73rocp] Achieving net zero typically involves aggressive emissions cuts across all sectors and only using carbon removal for emissions that cannot be entirely eliminated.

### What Are Net Zero Targets?

- **Definition:** Net zero means that the amount of GHGs emitted into the atmosphere is balanced by an equal amount being removed. The goal is *not* to emit no carbon, but to ensure any emissions are offset, effectively stopping the accumulation of GHGs in the atmosphere. [^rdyfq8] [^9lcnxz] [^t9lvrf]
- **Scope:** True net zero covers all sectors (energy, transport, industry, agriculture, waste, and sometimes international operations) and aims for actual emissions reductions rather than over-relying on offsets or carbon credits. [^rdyfq8] [^t9lvrf]
- **Corporate Approach:** The [[domains/vocabulary/Science Based Targets initiative|Science Based Targets initiative]] (SBTi) requires companies to:
  - Rapidly halve emissions by 2030 (near-term target)
  - Cut at least 90% of emissions by 2050 (long-term target)
  - Use carbon removal (not offsets) for any remaining residual emissions. [^v1v2id]

### Examples of Net Zero Targets Working

- **Countries:** The United Kingdom became one of the first major economies to pass a legally binding net zero target for 2050 and reported a 48% reduction in territorial emissions from 1990 to 2020, attributed to strong policy measures covering energy and transport. [^rdyfq8]
- **Companies:** Many large global companies (e.g., Microsoft, Ørsted) have set rigorous net zero targets according to the SBTi, achieving drastic cuts in their operational and supply chain emissions over recent years. [^v1v2id] For example, Ørsted, once a coal-heavy power producer, now generates 90% of its energy from renewables and is on track for net zero operations by 2025. [^v1v2id]
- **Practical Actions:** Electrification of fleets, investment in renewables, and reforestation programs are examples of implemented actions supporting net zero pathways. [^73rocp]

### Are Net Zero Targets Real or Greenwashing?

- **Authenticity:** The credibility of net zero targets depends on their ambition, comprehensiveness, reliance on actual emissions reductions versus offsets, and transparent reporting. [^rdyfq8] [^9lcnxz] Targets that:
  - Cover all sectors and all greenhouse gases,
  - Prioritize direct emissions cuts,
  - Legally bind implementation and include interim progress milestones,
  - Limit the use of offsets to residual emissions only,
are generally considered scientifically and ethically robust. [^rdyfq8] [^v1v2id] [^9lcnxz] [^t9lvrf]
- **[[Greenwashing]] Risks:** Some companies and governments set **vague or delayed targets**, rely heavily on cheap international carbon offsets instead of actual reductions, or exclude major emissions sources (like supply chains or international activities). [^9lcnxz] [^rdyfq8] These "soft" targets are often criticized as greenwashing—claiming climate leadership without fundamental change.
- **Independent Verification:** Best practices involve third-party verification (e.g., through the [[SBTi]]) and regular progress tracking to avoid greenwashing. [^v1v2id]

*Illustrate the difference between genuine net zero targets (broad coverage, deep cuts, minimal offsets) and greenwashing (narrow coverage, heavy offsets reliance, weak progress).*

---
**In summary:** Net zero targets are both real strategies and aspirational commitments. Their impact depends on the rigor of the targets, the transparency of implementation, and independent verification. While some lead to genuine emissions cuts, others may lack substance and serve primarily as public relations tools, meriting skepticism and closer examination.
