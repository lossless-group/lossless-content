## Introduction to E-Commerce

Electronic commerce, commonly referred to as eCommerce, is the process of buying and selling goods or services over the internet.

### Concept and Examples

eCommerce involves various transaction types, including Business-to-Consumer (B2C), Business-to-Business (B2B), and Customer-to-Customer (C2C) sales. It allows businesses to reach a global audience at a fraction of the cost required for traditional brick-and-mortar stores. For instance, platforms like Amazon and eBay are prime examples of B2C transactions, while Alibaba is prominent in B2B sales. Additionally, peer-to-peer marketplaces like Etsy facilitate C2C transactions among individuals.

### Benefits and Applications

The benefits of eCommerce are numerous. It offers **low startup costs** compared to traditional stores, allowing new businesses to enter the market more easily. It also provides **24/7 availability**, enabling customers to shop at any time from anywhere. Moreover, eCommerce offers **data-driven insights** through analytics tools, helping businesses understand customer behavior and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly. Scalability is another key advantage, as online stores can easily expand their product offerings and enter new markets without the need for physical expansion. [^at5fsz] [^y5mi2g]

However, eCommerce also presents challenges, such as **high competition** in saturated markets and **security risks** associated with handling sensitive customer data. Despite these challenges, eCommerce continues to grow, driven by innovations in payment systems, logistics, and digital marketing. [^y5mi2g] [^vqu2l7]
