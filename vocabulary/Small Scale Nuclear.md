# The Collision Course:

## Power Grids, AI, and Renewables

### AI needs Data Centers
The need for [[Vocabulary/Data Centers]] was already exponential. [[concepts/Explainers for AI/Artificial Intelligence|AI]] just added another exponent. Specialized GPU-based servers are even more power hungry than the CPU-based ones. 

### Robotics and Advanced Manufacturing
Factories have always consumed a lot of power. With the rise of advanced manufacturing, with power hungry robots of every type, this is exploding.

### Renewables at Peak
Renewables are now set to exceed the capacity of the grid to absorb them. While this is a good thing, Power Grids are not set up to handle the load, and we still don't have a good way to store surplus energy.
