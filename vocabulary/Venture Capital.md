Over the past ten years, **venture capital (VC) has experienced substantial transformation**, marked by dramatic funding cycles, changing geographic dominance, and major shifts in technology focus.

## Key Trends in Venture Capital (2015–2025)

- **Surge and Correction in Global VC Funding**
    - *Rapid Growth Period*: From 2015 to 2021, global VC investment grew at a 13.5% compound annual growth rate, peaking at unprecedented levels in 2021 (Q2: $157.1bn globally). [^2ry2zc]
    - *Correction Phase*: Since late 2022, funding volumes dropped sharply, with a 17% quarter-over-quarter decline noted in Q2 2025. This reflects a normalization after exceptional pandemic-era highs and outlier deals like OpenAI. [^6mw8zl]

- **Mega-Rounds and Market Volatility**
    - *Rise of Mega-Rounds*: Companies raising $100M+ saw an explosion from 111 rounds in 2015 to 859 in 2021, largely driven by interest in pre-IPO tech and life sciences. [^16zmha]
    - *Sudden Drop and Partial Recovery*: Count of $100M+ rounds fell dramatically in 2023 but rebounded in 2024, reflecting cyclical investor appetites and macroeconomic conditions. [^16zmha]

- **Geographic Shifts and Sector Focus**
    - *US Dominance*: The US consistently accounts for the largest share—capturing 52.8% (2020) and 64% (Q2 2025) of global VC activity—with resilience during periods of volatility. [^6mw8zl] [^2ry2zc]
    - *Europe’s Ascent and Cooling*: Europe enjoyed consecutive quarters of investment growth to record highs by 2021, then cooled by 2025 due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. [^6mw8zl] [^2ry2zc]
    - *Asia’s Unique Trajectory*: Asia’s VC activity peaked pre-pandemic and remains below Q3 2019 levels, with China subdued but India emerging as a strong spot in fintech and mobility. [^6mw8zl]

- **Deepening Focus on Technology**
    - *Generative AI and Software*: Since 2024, 45% of VC funding concentrated in software and AI—with generative AI showing record growth, particularly in development tools and applied AI. [^6mw8zl]
    - *Shift to Capital-Intensive Fields*: Investments now increasingly target hard tech, generative AI, and sectors like logistics, satellite tech, and space tourism. [^zy1rx1] [^6mw8zl]

- **Evolution in Investment Strategies**
    - *Boutique and Targeted Funds*: Growing trend toward boutique or “artisanal” venture firms that focus on early-stage startups, investing smaller amounts with hands-on support and industry expertise, often prioritizing founder relationships and domain expertise over purely financial metrics. [^zy1rx1]
    - *Valuation Corrections*: Investors increasingly prefer stronger, more profitable startups, with valuation discipline rising and market “cleanup” underway after the loose practices of the boom period. [^zm9oc4]
    - *Increasing Seed-Stage Deal Sizes*: Notable recent seed deals (e.g., $2B round for [[Tooling/AI-Toolkit/Model Producers/Thinking Machines|Thinking Machines]] show upward pressure on early-stage valuations, even as late-stage averages dip due to correction. [^6mw8zl]

- **Role of [[Vocabulary/Corporate Venture Capital|Corporate Venture Capital]] and Corporates**
    - *Steady Corporate VC Activity*: Corporate VCs have consistently accounted for about 36% of deal value in recent years, reflecting sustained interest in breakthrough technologies and willingness to fund capital-intensive ventures. [^6mw8zl]

- **Liquidity and Exit Challenges**
    - *IPO and M&A Market Volatility*: Fewer IPOs and exit opportunities since 2022 have slowed distributions to limited partners, causing liquidity constraints and shaping more cautious investment approaches. [^zy1rx1] [^zm9oc4]
