> [!LLM Response] Perplexity explains agile.
> 
> Explain agile methodologies in software development. How did it become a trend? Who first wrote about it or promoted it? What firms are known to be religious practitioners? What are the controversies? Is there any data or research to back up either believers or non-believers?

Agile methodologies have revolutionized software development by prioritizing flexibility, iterative progress, and customer collaboration over rigid, linear processes. Emerging as a response to the limitations of traditional models like Waterfall, Agile gained momentum in the 1990s and became mainstream after the 2001 [[Sources/Books/The Agile Manifesto|The Agile Manifesto]]. [^3z7fak] [^ykzi1j] Its adoption by major firms and proven benefits in dynamic environments solidified its trend status, though debates persist about misapplication, scalability, and cultural challenges. [^i6n54f] [^tozni5] [^uc8lgl]

### Core Principles and Methodologies  
Agile emphasizes delivering working software incrementally through short development cycles (*sprints*), continuous feedback, and adaptive planning. Key methodologies include:  
- **Scrum**: Uses time-boxed sprints (2–4 weeks), daily standups, and roles like Scrum Master/Product Owner. [^3z7fak] [^ykzi1j]  
- **Kanban**: Focuses on visualizing workflows and limiting work in progress. [^3z7fak] [^tozni5]  
- **Extreme Programming (XP)**: Prioritizes technical excellence through practices like test-driven development. [^ykzi1j]  

The Agile lifecycle involves six stages:  
1. **Concept**: Identifying business opportunities and feasibility. [^3z7fak] [^3mtqgd]  
2. **Inception**: Forming teams, defining requirements, and setting timelines. [^3z7fak]  
3. **Iteration**: Building software in cycles (2–4 weeks) with stakeholder feedback. [^3z7fak] [^3mtqgd]  
4. **Release**: Final testing and deployment. [^3z7fak]  
5. **Production**: Ongoing support and user training. [^3z7fak]  
6. **Retirement**: Phasing out outdated systems. [^3z7fak]  

### Rise to Prominence  
Agile’s origins trace to the 1990s, when developers sought alternatives to inflexible Waterfall methods. The pivotal moment came in February 2001, when 17 developers, including Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber (Scrum creators), published the *Agile Manifesto*. [^ykzi1j] Its four values—prioritizing individuals, working software, customer collaboration, and responsiveness to change—resonated widely. [^ykzi1j] [^tozni5] By the mid-2000s, frameworks like Scrum and XP became industry standards, accelerated by proven benefits:  
- 58% faster delivery of business results compared to Waterfall. [^i6n54f]  
- 40% reduction in defects at Cisco. [^euj4vc]  
- Improved team morale and transparency. [^euj4vc] [^tozni5]  

### Notable Adopters  
Several firms are recognized for deeply embedding Agile practices:  

| Company         | Methodology  | Outcome                                                                 |  
|-----------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **PayPal**      | Scrum        | Delivered 58 new products in 6 months post-transition. [^euj4vc]              |  
| **Philips**     | SAFe/Scrum   | Reduced release cycles from 18 to 6 months. [^euj4vc]                         |  
| **Spotify**     | Custom Scrum | Scaled Agile across global teams, boosting transparency. [^euj4vc]            |  
| **Sony (PlayStation)** | SAFe       | Saved $30M in the first year through streamlined workflows. [^euj4vc]         |  

### Controversies and Criticisms  
Despite its success, Agile faces scrutiny:  
1. **Misapplication**: Superficial adoption (“pseudo-Agile”) without cultural buy-in leads to failed implementations [^tozni5] . [^uc8lgl]  
2. **Scaling Challenges**: Large organizations struggle with coordination; frameworks like SAFe introduce complexity [^tozni5] . [^uc8lgl]  
3. **Overemphasis on Speed**: Rapid iterations risk technical debt and unstable products [^tozni5] . [^uc8lgl]  
4. **Cultural Resistance**: Transitioning from hierarchical structures to self-organizing teams often meets internal pushback [^i6n54f] . [^tozni5]  
5. **Documentation Gaps**: Minimal documentation complicates onboarding and long-term maintenance [^tozni5] . [^uc8lgl]  

### Evidence and Research  
Studies highlight Agile’s strengths and limitations:  
- **Pros**: Agile projects report 14–58% faster delivery, 40% fewer defects, and higher customer satisfaction in dynamic environments. [^euj4vc] [^qsdet8] [^5ctmfz]  
- **Cons**: Traditional methods outperform Agile in regulated industries with fixed scopes. [^qsdet8] Hybrid models (Agile + Waterfall) are increasingly popular for balancing flexibility and structure. [^qsdet8] [^5ctmfz]  
- ROI debates persist: Some studies show Agile’s benefit-to-cost ratio lags behind Waterfall, though it achieves business goals more consistently. [^i6n54f]  

Agile remains dominant in software development but requires thoughtful adaptation to avoid pitfalls. As organizations like BBVA and Philips demonstrate, success hinges on aligning Agile principles with company-wide cultural shifts. [^euj4vc] [^tozni5]
