According to [[Gartner]], [[Best-in-class]] is defined as the superior product within a category of hardware or software. It does not necessarily mean best product overall, however. For example, the best-in-class product in a low-priced category may be inferior to the best product on the market, which could sell for much more. [^1]

Not necessarily [[concepts/State of the Art|State of the Art]] or [[Vocabulary/Market Standard|Market Standard]].
