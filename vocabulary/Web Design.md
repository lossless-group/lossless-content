Web design and UI (User Interface) design are related but distinct fields within digital design, each with its own focus and responsibilities:

1. **Web Design**: This is a broader term that encompasses all aspects of the website's visual elements and functionality. It includes both front-end development (how the site looks) and back-end development (how it works). Web designers are responsible for the layout, color schemes, typography, images, and overall user experience of a website. They ensure that the site is not only visually appealing but also easy to navigate and use across various devices and screen sizes.

2. **[[Vocabulary/UI Design|UI Design]]**: This is more specialized and concentrates on the look and feel of digital interfaces, specifically focusing on how users interact with an application or website. UI designers are concerned with creating interfaces that are intuitive, aesthetically pleasing, and easy to use. They define the layout, structure, and behavior of digital products' screens, buttons, icons, and other interactive elements. While web design deals with the overall website structure and functionality, UI design focuses on the specific interface details that users directly interact with.

In summary, while there's overlap between these two fields (a good web designer will often incorporate principles of UI design), they have different scopes: Web design is about creating the entire [[Vocabulary/Digital Experience|Digital Experience]] of a site, whereas UI design is more concerned with the visual and interactive elements users engage with directly.
