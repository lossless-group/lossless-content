> **Question:**
> How can Google defend their 20% time policy?  How many new products and services have come from it?  How much value has it created for Google?
> 
> ### **Response from sonar-pro**:

Google can defend their 20% time policy by highlighting its direct role in generating some of the company’s most successful and innovative products—such as **Gmail**, **Google News**, and **AdSense**—as well as its broader, transformative impact on corporate culture, innovation, and talent retention.

**Key Ways Google Defends the 20% Time Policy:**

- **Innovation Generation:** Several of Google's flagship products were directly born out of the 20% time initiative, including:
    - **Gmail**: Developed as an engineer’s side project, later redefining webmail with large storage and advanced search features. [^o8qzum] [^32fw8t]
    - **Google News**: Created in response to the fragmented news following the September 11 attacks, providing news aggregation and becoming widely used globally. [^o8qzum] [^32fw8t]
    - **AdSense**: Evolved from a 20% time project, this became central to Google’s business model and a multi-billion dollar revenue generator. [^o8qzum] [^32fw8t] [^ai7xuf]
    - **Google Maps** is sometimes also cited, though sources emphasize Gmail, News, and AdSense as core 20% outputs. [^32fw8t]

- **Cultural and Strategic Value**:  
    - **Encourages creativity and cross-collaboration**: Employees from diverse backgrounds team up, leading to fresh perspectives and novel ideas. [^32fw8t] [^ppz7wt]
    - **Fosters risk-taking, experimentation, and learning from failure**: Normalizes pursuing ambitious ideas without fear of negative consequences, thus unlocking creative potential. [^32fw8t]
    - **Attracts and retains top talent**: The freedom to work on meaningful projects has become a significant incentive for world-class engineers and researchers to join and stay at Google. [^32fw8t]

- **Signal to Industry**: The policy positions Google as a pioneer in modern management and innovation practice, influencing other tech giants to launch similar initiatives (e.g., Apple’s “Blue Sky,” Atlassian’s ‘20% time’). [^ppz7wt] [^ai7xuf]

**Quantitative Output and Value Creation:**

- **Number of Major Products Originated**: The most widely confirmed products from the 20% time are Gmail, Google News, AdSense, and (by some accounts) Google Maps. [^o8qzum] [^32fw8t] [^ai7xuf] These alone represent substantial additions to Google’s portfolio.
- **Financial Value**: 
    - **AdSense** alone generated billions in annual revenue, becoming a key profit driver for Google. [^o8qzum] [^32fw8t]
    - **Gmail** and **Google News** contributed to user engagement, ecosystem stickiness, and data generation—all critical to Google's ad-driven model. [^o8qzum]
- **Long-term Value**: Even projects that did not become core products often led to advancements, internal process improvements, or technology that benefited other Google services.

**Criticism and Limitation Acknowledgment:**
- Some analysts argue about the true extent of the policy’s implementation over time and whether the perception of “20% time” exceeds its widespread practical usage. [^ai7xuf] [^ppz7wt]
- There are concerns about IP ownership and the potential for exploitation, as all side project outcomes become company property. [^ai7xuf]

In summary, the 20% time policy is defensible both as a concrete innovation engine—having led to products worth billions—and as a strategic method for building a creative, risk-tolerant, and attractive work culture. [^o8qzum] [^32fw8t] [^ai7xuf] [^ppz7wt]
