> Libraries or applications that live entirely within the terminal, such as **Yazi** or **Neovim**, are typically referred to as **Text User Interfaces (TUIs)** or **Console User Interfaces (CUIs)**. These applications provide a user interface that is rendered using text characters, often using libraries like **ncurses**, **blessed**, or **Ratatui** to manage the display and input within the terminal environment.
> 
> ## Key Features of TUIs:
> 
> - **Text-based interface**: The entire user experience is presented using text characters.
>     
> - **Terminal control**: These applications often use terminal control libraries to manage the display and input.
>     
> - **Interactive**: Users can interact with TUIs using keyboard and sometimes mouse input.
>     
> 
> ## Examples of TUI Applications:
> 
> - **Yazi**: A terminal file manager written in Rust.
>     
> - **Neovim**: A text editor that runs in the terminal.
>     
> - **htop**: A system monitoring tool that provides a text-based interface.
>     
> 
> ## Libraries Used for TUI Development:
> 
> - **ncurses**: A classic library for creating TUIs, widely used in C applications.
>     
> - **Ratatui**: A Rust library for building TUIs.
>     
> - **blessed**: A Node.js library for creating TUIs.
>     
> 
> These libraries and applications are designed to provide efficient, text-based interfaces that can be used directly within terminal emulators or windows.
