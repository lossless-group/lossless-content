Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a form of cloud computing where a third-party provider offers fundamental computing resources such as virtual machines (VMs), storage, and networking on demand over the internet. Instead of purchasing, maintaining, and upgrading physical data centers and servers, users can access these resources from a cloud service provider.

Key features of IaaS include:
1. On-demand self-service: Users can provision computing resources without human interaction with the service provider.
2. Broad network access: Capabilities are accessible over the network and can be reached through standard mechanisms by various client platforms (e.g., web services, mobile apps).
3. Resource pooling: The provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model.
4. Rapid elasticity: Capabilities can be rapidly and elastically provisioned, in some cases automatically, to quickly scale out and rapidly released to quickly scale in.
5. Measured service: Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service.

Major providers of Infrastructure as a Service are:

1. Amazon Web Services (AWS): AWS is the largest player in the IaaS market, offering a wide range of services including compute power, storage options, databases, and networking capabilities. Notable services include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Simple Storage Service (S3), and Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

2. Microsoft Azure: Azure provides a comprehensive set of cloud services, enabling developers and IT professionals to build, deploy, and manage applications through Microsoft-managed data centers. Its offerings include Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Storage, and Azure Virtual Network.

3. Google Cloud Platform (GCP): GCP offers infrastructure resources across 24 regions and 73 zones worldwide. It provides services such as Compute Engine for VMs, Cloud Storage for object storage, and Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network for secure connectivity.

4. IBM Cloud: IBM Cloud provides virtual servers, bare metal servers, and cloud-native services like Kubernetes and AI capabilities. Notable offerings include IBM Virtual Servers, IBM Cloud Object Storage, and IBM Cloud Foundations for building modern applications.

5. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI): OCI offers a broad portfolio of infrastructure services including compute, storage, networking, and container orchestration. Key services include Bare Metal & VM Instances, Object Storage, and FastConnect for dedicated network connections.

6. Alibaba Cloud: Alibaba Cloud is China's leading provider of cloud computing services and offers a wide range of IaaS solutions like Elastic Compute Service (ECS), Object Storage Service (OSS), and Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). 

These providers continue to innovate, expanding their offerings and competing on factors such as pricing, performance, reliability, security, and ease of use.


# Innovators & Alternatives
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) has seen significant contributions from not just tech giants like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), but also from emerging players. Here are some of the lesser-known yet innovative companies offering IaaS:

1. [[Tooling/Software Development/Cloud Infrastructure/Digital Ocean|Digital Ocean]]: Known for its simplicity and affordability, DigitalOcean offers a wide range of cloud computing services, including virtual machines, object storage, and managed databases. It's particularly popular among developers due to its user-friendly interface.

2. [[Linode]]: Another strong contender in the IaaS market, Linode provides high-performance cloud hosting. It's known for its stability, simplicity, and customer support. 

3. [[Tooling/Software Development/Cloud Infrastructure/Vultr|Vultr]]: Founded by a team of former CloudSigma executives, Vultr offers global, high-performance data centers with a focus on ease of use and affordability.

4. Hetzner Cloud: Based in Germany, Hetzner provides robust and affordable cloud solutions with a strong emphasis on data privacy and security. 

5. UpCloud: This European provider is known for its fast, low-latency servers and straightforward pricing model.

6. OVHcloud: Another European player, OVHcloud offers a vast range of services including IaaS, with a focus on [[concepts/Data Sovereignty]] and high availability.

7. Scaleway: This French company is known for its bare metal cloud servers, providing direct access to hardware resources.

8. CloudSigma: Swiss-based CloudSigma provides virtual private servers (VPS) with root access, enabling users to customize their infrastructure as needed.

9. [[Exoscale]]: Based in Switzerland, Exoscale offers a robust IaaS platform with a focus on security and compliance.

10. Packet: Known for its bare-metal cloud offering, Packet provides direct access to physical servers, giving users the flexibility to customize their infrastructure.

These companies are carving out niches in the IaaS market by focusing on specific user needs such as simplicity, affordability, or specialized services, making them compelling alternatives to the larger players.
