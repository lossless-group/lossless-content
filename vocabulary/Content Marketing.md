Content marketing is a strategic approach to marketing focused on creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a clearly defined audience — ultimately driving profitable customer action. 

The main goal of this method isn't to explicitly sell a product or service in the traditional sense, but rather to engage potential customers by providing them with information that is useful, informative, or entertaining. This content can take many forms including blog posts, videos, podcasts, infographics, ebooks, and social media updates.

Content marketing aims to build trust and brand loyalty among consumers, position a company as an industry leader, improve SEO rankings through keyword-rich content, and drive profitable customer action by guiding prospects down the sales funnel with targeted content at each stage of their buyer's journey. 

By offering valuable content for free, businesses can attract potential customers who are more likely to engage with the brand when they need a product or service in that category. This approach often leads to higher conversion rates and customer retention compared to traditional interruptive advertising methods.
