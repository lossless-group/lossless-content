In a business context, friction generally refers to any element or process that creates resistance, hinders progress, or adds unnecessary complexity within the operations of a company. This could manifest in several ways:

1. **Operational Friction**: These are obstacles that slow down or complicate routine business tasks and processes. Examples include outdated software systems that don't communicate well with each other, cumbersome approval processes, or siloed departments that make it hard for information to flow freely across the organization.

2. **Customer Friction**: This refers to any part of the customer journey that is difficult, inconvenient, or frustrating. It could be a complicated checkout process on an e-commerce site, unclear instructions, poor customer service, or lack of availability in store locations. High customer friction can lead to decreased sales and customer dissatisfaction.

3. **Organizational Friction**: This type of friction arises within the company's structure or culture. It might include bureaucracy, lack of communication, unclear roles, or resistance to change, all of which can hinder collaboration, innovation, and overall business agility.

The goal in business is often to reduce or eliminate these types of friction to streamline operations, enhance customer experience, and improve overall efficiency. This can lead to cost savings, increased productivity, and better competitive positioning.
