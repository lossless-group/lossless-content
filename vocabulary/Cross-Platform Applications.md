When people refer to **cross-platform applications**, they mean software designed to run on multiple operating systems or platforms, such as Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android. This allows users to access the same application seamlessly across different devices and operating systems. [^exz3jg] [^el9a1k] [^9ffh7r]

### Platforms Being Crossed
Typically, cross-platform applications span:
- **Desktop platforms**: Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Mobile platforms**: iOS and Android.
- **Web browsers**: Applications accessible via the internet.
Some apps may also support less common platforms like HarmonyOS or KaiOS. [^qju86v] [^el9a1k] [^9ffh7r]

### How Providers Create and Maintain Cross-Platform Apps
Developers use several strategies to handle the complexity:
1. **Shared Codebase**: A single codebase is written using frameworks like [[Tooling/Enterprise Jobs-to-be-Done/Flutter]], [[Tooling/Software Development/Frameworks/React Native]], or [[Xamarin]]. This code is designed to work across platforms with minimal modifications. [^qju86v] [^rvc4is] [^5riaki]
2. **Abstraction Layers**: These frameworks abstract platform-specific details, allowing developers to focus on app functionality without worrying about underlying differences. [^exz3jg] [^rvc4is]
3. **Platform-Specific Customization**: Some parts of the app (e.g., UI) are tailored to specific platforms to ensure a native-like experience while maintaining shared logic. [^qju86v] [^9ffh7r]
4. **Testing and Optimization**: Rigorous testing ensures compatibility across various devices, screen sizes, and OS versions. [^rvc4is]

This approach reduces development time and cost while reaching a broader audience efficiently. However, it requires careful planning to manage performance trade-offs and maintain consistency across platforms. [^qju86v] [^rvc4is] [^kr2dag]
