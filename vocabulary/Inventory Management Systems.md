> What are the categories of software that are used in Inventory Management for large scale CPG manufacturers?
> 

**Large-scale CPG (consumer packaged goods) manufacturers typically utilize multiple categories of software to manage inventory and related operations. These software categories integrate to support complex supply chains, high production volumes, and compliance needs.**[^am6p4z] [^5ui06h] [^q8ypp8]

### Main Software Categories Used in Inventory Management

- **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems**  
  [[concepts/Explainers for Tooling/Enterprise Resource Planning|ERPs]] like SAP S/4HANA, NetSuite, Microsoft Dynamics 365, Acumatica, BatchMaster, and Deacom are central to CPG inventory management. They combine modules for inventory tracking, procurement, production, sales, compliance, finance, and reporting—providing end-to-end visibility and automation across large organizations. [^am6p4z] [^u1qwst] [^5ui06h] [^q8ypp8]

- **Warehouse Management Systems (WMS)**  
  WMS software specializes in controlling operations inside distribution centers: inventory movement, barcode/RFID integration, slotting, picking, packing, automated cycle counting, and labor management. These systems often integrate with ERPs for a unified inventory picture. [^am6p4z] [^5ui06h]

- **Inventory Management Systems (IMS)**  
  IMS software (standalone or a feature of ERP/WMS) provides fine-grained inventory control: tracking raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, lot/batch tracking, and multi-location synchronization. Automation features may include stock level optimization and real-time alerts. [^5ui06h]

- **Demand Planning & Forecasting Tools**  
  These tools analyze historical sales, seasonal trends, and market data to predict demand—enabling more accurate [[Vocabulary/Demand Forecasting|Demand Forecasting]], inventory replenishment and production planning. Many ERPs offer embedded forecasting modules, but specialized systems or advanced analytics platforms are also used in large CPG firms. [^am6p4z]

- **Supply Chain Management (SCM) Platforms**  
  SCM software addresses broader logistics by integrating supplier management, procurement, transportation, order fulfillment, and traceability. These systems help ensure raw material availability, optimize inbound/outbound logistics, and increase supply chain responsiveness. [^u1qwst] [^q8ypp8]

- **Regulatory Compliance & Traceability Solutions**  
  Especially in food, beverage, or regulated segments, dedicated modules or third-party systems support compliance (e.g., FDA, FSMA), lot/batch-level traceability, recall management, and audit readiness. [^am6p4z] [^q8ypp8]

- **Integration Middleware**  
  Middleware or integration platforms connect legacy systems, e-commerce, retail POS, and partner systems with inventory, WMS, and ERP systems—ensuring real-time data consistency across heterogeneous environments.

### Common Feature Areas (Often Integrated Across Categories)
- **Order Fulfillment Automation** (from order capture to shipping and billing)[^am6p4z] [^u1qwst] [^5ui06h]
- **Reporting and Analytics** (dashboards, financials, [[Vocabulary/Key Performance Indicators|KPI]] monitoring)[^u1qwst]
- **[[Vocabulary/CRM|Customer Relationship Management]] (CRM)** for coordinating inventory allocation with sales activities[^am6p4z] [^u1qwst]
- **Financial Management** for inventory valuation, costing, and cash flow analysis[^am6p4z] [^u1qwst]
- **Multi-channel and Omnichannel Support** to synchronize inventory across retail, B2B, e-commerce, and direct-to-consumer channels[^am6p4z] [^5ui06h]

CPG manufacturers typically select either a robust, modular ERP suite encompassing all these functions, or a best-in-class combination of specialized platforms integrated into a unified workflow for maximum scale and control. [^am6p4z] [^u1qwst] [^q8ypp8]
